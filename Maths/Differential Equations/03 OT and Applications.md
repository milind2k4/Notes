# OT and Applications 
## Orthogonal Trajectory (OT)
For a given family of curves (say $C_{1}$), OT is defined as another family of curves (say $C_{2}$) such that each member of 2nd family will intersect with each member of 1st family at right angles. 

If a family of curves is given then to find equation of its OT, we,
1. Form DE of given family 
2. Replace $y'$ with $- \frac{1}{y'}$ in obtained DE. 
3. Solve obtained DE.

For Example,

## Isogonal Trajectory (IT)
It is a general case of OT.

If a family of curves is given then its IT will be another family of curves each member of which will intersect with each member of given family at a constant angle, say $\theta$. 

To find IT of a given family of curves,
$$\pm \tan \theta = \frac{ m_{1} - m_{2} }{ 1 + m_{1}m_{2} }$$
$$\pm \tan \theta = \frac{ (y')_{F_{2}} - (y')_{F_{1}} }{ 1 + (y')_{F_{1}}(y')_{F_{2}} }$$

In this, we substitute for $(y')_{F_{1}}$ and then solve for $F_{2}$.
