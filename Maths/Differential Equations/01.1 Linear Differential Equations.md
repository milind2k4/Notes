# Linear Differential Equation (LDE)
#important 

Equation of the form,
$$\frac{ dy }{ dx } + P(x)y = Q(x)$$
it might not be clear from the start, so we might have to do some substitution or else. 

To solve, we define *Integrating Factor,*
$$IF = e^{^{ \Large  \int P(x) \, dx } } = \exp\left( \int P(x) \, dx \right)$$

Then we multiply it with the given equation,
$$
\begin{split}
e^{ \int P \, dx } \frac{ dy }{ dx } + e^{ \int P \, dx } . P. y &= Q e^{ \int P \, dx  }
\end{split}
$$
This is the form of [[08 Exact Derivatives]], and thus we can write,
$$\frac{ d }{ dx }  (y. e^{ \int P \, dx }) = Q e^{ \int P \, dx }$$
$$y. e^{ \int P \, dx } = \int Q e^{ \int P \, dx } \, dx$$

To save time, we go directly to,
$$y. (IF) = \int (RHS) (IF) \, dx$$

Equation could also be linear in x,
$$\frac{ dx }{ dy } + P(y)x = Q(y)$$

Then,
$$IF = e^{ ^{ \Large \int P(y) \, dy }  }$$
And the solution will be,
$$x IF = \int Q(y). IF \, dy $$

Equation can also have the form $d(y.f)$ required from the start,
$$
\begin{split}
f(x) \frac{ dy }{ dx } + f'(x) y &= g(x) \\
y.f(x) &= \int g(x) \, dx
\end{split}
$$

Also, if we see a function linearly added to its derivative, then it may imply application of LDE.
I.e.
$$\frac{ dy }{ dx } + k.y \text{ pattern}$$
