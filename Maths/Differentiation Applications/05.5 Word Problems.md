# Maxima and Minima in Physical Situations

To find optimum value of a given quantity,
1. If possible, make diagram. 
2. Assume a variable or variables. Keep the number as low as possible. 
3. Express quantity to be optimised in terms of assumed variable(s).
4. Differentiate to find maxima or minima, and hence find the optimum value of required quantity.

#### Points to Remember 
After Differentiation verify whether it is max. or min. 

Using this method, we will be finding maxima or minima of quantities which are functions of a single variable. If quantity is expressed in terms of more than one variable, then it will be solved using AM GM etc. 

Optimum means desired, i.e. it may be max. or min. Depending upon situation. 

If more than one quantities are to be optimised, then make their functions separately and then differentiate.   

Many a times, derivatives will not be required to find maxima/minima. We might use [[06.5 AM, GM, HM Inequality|AM-GM]], D $\geq$ 0, perfect square etc. 

When quantity Q (which is to be optimised), is written in terms of variable x (say), then write allowed value of x also. 

To maximise or minimise a +ve quantity Q, we can maximise or minimise $Q^{2}, Q^{3}, Q^{4}$ etc.
