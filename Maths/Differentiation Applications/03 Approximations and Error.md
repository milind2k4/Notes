# Approximation or Error
If a function is given and we make an increase in x, the y will also change. 

In $\Delta ABC$, 
$$\Delta y = \Delta x \tan \alpha$$
Now, if $\Delta x$ is small, $\alpha \approx \theta$ and we can write,
$$\Delta y \approx \Delta x \tan \theta$$
And thus, giving,
$$y_{f} = y_{i} + (\Delta x) \left. \frac{ dy }{ dx } \right|_{A}$$
Where the value of $dy /dx$ is to be calculated at the initial point of x (i.e. A).

This is mathematical approximation and it also gives the error. 

$$\Delta y = \Delta x \left. \frac{ dy }{ dx } \right|_{A} $$
where $\Delta y$ is error in y and $\Delta x$ is that in x.
