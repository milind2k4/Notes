# Concavity
For a twice differentiable function, 
- $y'' > 0 \implies$ Concave Upwards. I.e. slope will be an increasing function. 
- $y'' < 0 \implies$ Concave Downwards. I.e. slope will be a decreasing function.

For concave upward (downward) curve, if we join any two points on it, then the resulting line segment will lie entirely above (below) the curve. 

This is used to prove/solve inequalities.

For concave upward (downward) curve, if we tangent at any point on it, then it will lie entirely below (above) the curve.

## Point of Inflection
It is a point where curve changes its concavity. The curve can be discontinuous or non differentiable also.

If $x = k$ is point of inflection, then let before x = k, function $f(x)$ is concave up and after is concave down, then, the curve of slope will have local maxima.

Hence for a differentiable function $y = f(x)$, if $x = k$ is point of inflection, then it will be point of local minima or maxima for $y = f'(x)$

Therefore,
$$f' = f'' = 0$$

Thus to find point of inflection, we find the roots of $f''(x) = 0$ when it changes sign.

## Curve Sketching
1. Find domain, roots, points of discontinuity and symmetry (if any).
   - If we replace x with -x and there is no effect, the graph is symmetric about y axis.
   - If we replace y with -y and there is no effect, the graph is symmetric about x axis.
   - If we replace x, y with -x, -y and there is no effect, the graph is symmetric about origin.

2. Find values and/or limiting values at end points of domain and at points of  discontinuity. 
     $\\$
     
1. Find derivative and hence analyse local maxima, minima and monotonic behaviour. 
     $\\$
     
1. If needed then we can analyse concavity as well.
