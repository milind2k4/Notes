# Rate Change
If rate change of quantity $q_{1}$ is given and that of $q_{2}$ is required, then try to find a relation between these two quantities and differentiate the equation. 

If $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ are related via $q_{3}$ then eliminate $q_{3}$. If elimination of the third variable is difficult, try to eliminate it after differentiation.

Keep track of dimensions of different quantities. 

If rate change is required at certain moment, put value of variables after differentiation. 

To find linear speed of a point, diff. its distance (along the speed) from a fixed point. 

If a quantity is decreasing (increasing) with time, then its derivative wrt time will be -ve (+ve). 

## Examples: Rate Change

Take care to note which are variable are which are constant.
