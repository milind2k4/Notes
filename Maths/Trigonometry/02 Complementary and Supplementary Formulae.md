$$T\left( \frac{ \pi }{ 2 }\pm \theta \right),\ T(\pi \pm \theta) \text{ formulae}$$ 
assume that the $\theta$ is less than 90. The formula however, will always be correct even if the angle is big.

## If odd multiple of $\displaystyle \frac{\pi}{2}$ is used
1. $$\sin \longleftrightarrow \cos $$
1. $$\tan \longleftrightarrow \cot $$
1. $$\sec \longleftrightarrow \csc $$
And sign is according to the sign of the LHS function in the quadrant where the angle lands. 
Eg. $\cos \left(419 \frac{\pi}{2} + \theta\right)= \sin(\theta)$

## If multiple of $\pi$ is used
There is no change in the function. $\sin$ remains $\sin$ and so on. 
And sign is according to the sign of the LHS function in the quadrant where the angle lands.
