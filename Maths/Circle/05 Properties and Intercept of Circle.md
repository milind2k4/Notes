# Important Properties of Circle 

#### Properties of Chords
Chord closer to centre will be bigger and the biggest chord is diameter which passes through centre. Thus chords equidistant from the centre will be equal in length.

Foot of perpendicular from centre to any chord bisects it. 
Or, Perpendicular bisector of any chord passes through centre.

A chord makes equal angles at circumference and the angle made by it at the centre is double of the angle made at circumference.

Angle made by a chord at major arc will be acute and at minor arc will be obtuse. Also sum of these angles will be $\pi$.

If there is a point on any chord (either inside or outside) then the product of lengths in which it divides the chord is constant.  #important

Proof:
![[Pasted image 20230714085404.png]]

A chord makes equal angles with the tangent at  one of its end point and on alternate segment.

If P is a point inside the circle then the smallest chord of  this circle passing through P will be the one which is bisected at P. The biggest is the one which passes through centre which will be diameter. 
The longest and shortest chords will be mutually perpendicular

##### Cyclic Quadrilateral 
**Cyclic Quadrilateral** is one for which there exists a circle which can pass through all 4 vertices. 

For a cyclic quadrilateral, sum of opposite angles will be $\pi$.

#### Properties between Points and Circles
If A, B, C are 3 non collinear point, then there will be a unique circle passing through A, B, C. We can find this by finding perpendicular bisectors of any two points.

If A, B are two distinct point, then there will be infinite circles passing through them, and the one for which AB is diameter will be the smallest.

#### Properties of Tangents
Chord of contact is the line which joins the points of contact of tangents drawn from P to the circle.

The angular bisector of angle between the tangents drawn from point P to a circle will pass through its centre.

Length of tangents drawn from a point to circle will be equal in length. 

The quadrilateral formed by the tangents and radii is cyclic. Thus ACBP is cyclic. 

#### Properties of Normal

Normal is a straight line perpendicular to tangent at the point of tangency. Normal to a circle at any point will pass through its centre.

## Intercept Made by Circle 
Intercepts are on coordinate axes. 

Let the circle be,
$$x^{2} + y^{2} + 2gx + 2fx + c = 0$$

#### x intercept 
![[Pasted image 20230714095741.png]]

Then length AB is called intercept made by circle on x-axis. 

For A and B, put y = 0 in equation of circle,
$$x^{2} + 2gx + c = 0$$
If this has real roots then the circle is intersecting x axis. The roots of this equation will give the x coordinates of A and B.

The x intercept will be $AB = |x_{B} - x_{A}|$. This is the the difference of roots of above equation. Thus,
$$AB = \left| \frac{ \sqrt{ D } }{ a } \right| = 2\sqrt{ g^{2} - c } $$

Alternatively, we drop perpendicular from centre to the x axis,
Intercept = AB = 2AM
$$
\begin{split}
AB &= 2\sqrt{ AC^{2} - CM^{2} } \\
&= \sqrt{ r^{2} - f^{2} } \\
&= 2\sqrt{ g^{2} - c }
\end{split}
$$

Similarly, intercept made by circle on y axis,
$$y-\text{intercept} = 2\sqrt{ f^{2} - c }$$

#### Note
If $g^{2} > c$ then circle will intersect x axis at two distinct points. 
If $g^{2} = c$ then circle will touch x axis at one point. 
If $g^{2} < c$ then circle will not touch or cut x axis. I.e. it will lie entirely on one side of x axis. 


Similarly with y axis,
If $f^{2} > c$ then circle will intersect y axis at two distinct points. 
If $f^{2} = c$ then circle will touch y axis at one point. 
If $f^{2} < c$ then circle will not touch or cut y axis. I.e. it will lie entirely on one side of x axis. 

Radius,
If $g^{2} > c$ then $g^{2} + f^{2} > c$. 
If $g^{2}< c$ then $g^{2} + f^{2} \geq\ or \leq c$.
