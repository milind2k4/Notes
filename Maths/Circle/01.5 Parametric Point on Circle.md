# Parametric Point on Circle 
[[02 Equation of a Line#Parametric Equation]]

A parametric point on the circle,
$$(x-h)^{2} + (y-k)^{2} = r^{2}$$
Can be taken as,
$$P:(h+r\cos \theta, k+r\sin \theta)$$
where $\theta \in [0, 2\pi)$ is parameter, $(h,k)$ is centre and r is radius.
Since h,k and r are fixed and only $\theta$ changes, we can say "A point $\theta$ on the circle" to refer to point P.

For standard circle, a parametric point can be taken as,
$$p:(r\cos \theta, r\sin \theta)$$

#### Equation of Chord joining two point on Circle
Let $P(\theta_{1})$ and $Q(\theta_{2})$ are two points on the circle 
$$x^{2} + y^{2} = r^{2}$$
Then equation of chord PQ can be given as,
$$PQ \equiv x\cos\left( \frac{ \theta_{1} + \theta_{2} }{ 2 } \right) + y\sin\left( \frac{ \theta_{1} + \theta_{2} }{ 2 } \right) = r \cos \left( \frac{ \theta_{1} - \theta_{2} }{ 2 } \right)$$
We can remember this by thinking that the equation should be symmetric between $\theta_{1}$ and $\theta_{2}$
