# Radicle Axis and Radicle Centre 
Radicle Axis (RA) of two circles $S_{1} = 0$ and $S_{2} = 0$ is the locus of a point P which has equal power wrt both the circles. 

$$S_{i} = x^{2} + y^{2} + 2g_{i}x + 2f_{i}y + c_{i} = 0,\ i = 1,2$$
And let $P:(h,k)$ then if P lies on RA, then,
$$S_{1}(h,k) = S_{2}(h,k)$$
$$2(g_{1} - g_{2})h + 2(f_{1} - f_{2})k + c_{1} - c_{2} = 0$$
Putting x,y in place of h,k for locus, we get,
$$2(g_{1} - g_{2})x + 2(f_{1} - f_{2})y + c_{1} - c_{2} = 0$$
Which is nothing but,
$$S_{1} - S_{2} = 0$$

Slope of RA,
$$m_{RA} = - \left( \frac{ g_{1}-g_{2} }{ f_{1}-f_{2} } \right)$$
Slope of $C_{1}C_{2}$,
$$m_{C_{1}C_{2}} = \frac{ f_{1} - f_{2} }{ g_{1}-g_{2} }$$

Thus RA is a straight line perpendicular to line joining centres of the two circles. 

RA of two circles always exists except in the case when circles are concentric.

If circles are intersecting, then RA will be their common chord. 
If circles are touching, then RA will be their common tangent at common point. 

Any point on radicle axis will either lie inside, outside or on both the circles.
In any other case, the power of the point wrt both the circles cannot be equal.

So, if one of the circles is contained by the other circle, then their RA will lie outside both.

If P lies on RA outside both the circles, then for P,
$$
\begin{split}
S_{1p} &= S_{2p} \\
\sqrt{ S_{1p} } &= \sqrt{ S_{2p} } \\
\text{length of tangent from P on } S_{1} &= \text{length of tangent from P on } S_{2}
\end{split}
$$
Thus from any point or RA which lies outside both the circles, we can draw tangents of equal length to both circles.

RA bisects the common tangents of two circles. 
$$AT_{1} = AT_{2}\ \& \ BT_{3} = BT_{4}$$

If a circle $S = 0$ intersects two given circles $S_{1}= 0$ and $S_{2}=0$ orthogonally, them locus of its centre will be RA of the given circles.

#### Coaxial System
[[04 Family of Circles]]

**A system of circles is called coaxial system if each pair of this system has same RA.**
If $S_{1} = 0$ and $S_{2} = 0$ are two circles of such system, then any other circle of this system can be given as,
$$S_{1} + \lambda S_{2} = 0$$

Also if $S = 0$ is one circle of such system which has $L = 0$ as RA, then any other circle of this system can be given as,
$$S + \Lambda L = 0$$

### Radicle Centre 
If 3 circles 
$$S_{i} = x^{2} + y^{2} + 2g_{i}x + 2f_{i}y + c_{i} = 0,\ i = 1,2,3$$
are given, then their radicle axis in pair will be concurrent at a point which is called **Radicle Centre.**

![[Pasted image 20230731074604.png]]

If all 3 circles have centre on a straight line, then the RA in pair will be parallel and there will be no RC. 

RC can lie either outside or inside all three circles. 

If RC lies outside the circles, then it is the only point from which tangents of equal length can be drawn to all 3 circles. 

If a circle S intersects 3 given circles orthogonally then its centre will be the RC of the 3 given circles and radius will be length of tangent from RC to any circle.
