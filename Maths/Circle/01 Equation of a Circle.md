# Equation of Circle in different Forms 
### Standard Equation
Here $C:(0,0)$ and radius = r.
$$x^{2} + y^{2} = r^{2}$$

### General Equation 
$$x^{2} + y^{2} + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0$$
Centre,
$$C:(-g,-f)$$
$$r = \sqrt{ g^{2} + f ^{2} - c }$$

### Various Circles
- Circle passes through centre, c = 0.
	$$x^{2} + y^{2} + 2gx + 2fy = 0$$

- Circle touches x axis at $(a,0)$ and has radius as r then the centre will be $C:(a, \pm r)$. 
	$$(x - a)^{2} + (y \pm r)^{2} = r^{2}$$

- Circle touches y axis at $(0,b)$ and has radius as r, then the centre will be $C:(\pm r, b)$.
	$$(x \pm r)^{2} + (y - b)^{2} = r^{2}$$

- Centre on x axis and touching y axis at origin and having radius r.
	The centre will be at $C:(\pm r, 0)$. 
	$$(x \pm r^{2}) + (y- 0)^{2} = r^{2}$$
	$$x^{2} + y^{2} \pm 2rx = 0$$

- Centre on y axis and touching x axis at origin and having radius r.
	The centre will be at $C:(0, \pm r)$. 
	$$(x - 0) + (y \pm r)^{2} = r^{2}$$
	$$x^{2} + y^{2} \pm 2ry = 0$$

- Circle with radius r and touching both coordinate axes. 
  Here the centre will be $C:(\pm r, \pm r)$.  There will be 4 such circles, one for each combination of +,-.
	$$(x \pm r)^{2} + (y \pm r)^{2} = r^{2}$$
	$$x^{2} + y^{2} \pm 2rx \pm 2ry + r^{2} = 0$$

### Diameter Form 
The end points of the diameter are given.

Let $A:(x_{1},y_{1})$ and $B:(x_{2},y_{2})$ are the end points of diameter of a circle. 

#### Using Simple Coordinate Geometry
Centre can be given as, 
$$C:\left( \frac{ x_{1} + x_{2} }{ 2 }, \frac{ y_{1} + y_{2} }{ 2 } \right)$$
And radius can be given by,
$$r = \frac{ \sqrt{ (x_{2} - x_{1})^{2} + (y_{2} - y_{1})^{2} } }{ 2 }$$
Thus equation of circle can be given as,
$$\left( x - \frac{ x_{1} + x_{2} }{ 2 } \right)^{2} + \left( y - \frac{ y_{1} + y_{2} }{ 2 } \right)^{2} = \frac{ (x_{1} - x_{2})^{2} + (y_{1} - y_{2})^{2} }{ 4 }$$

#### Using Pythagoras Theorem
If P is on the circle,

$$PA^{2} + PB^{2} + AB^{2}$$
Which gives,
$$(x - x_{1})^{2} + (y - y_{1})^{2} + (x - x_{2})^{2} + (y - y_{2})^{2} = (x_{1} - x_{2})^{2} + (y_{1} - y_{2})^{2}$$

#### Using Slopes
#important 

Here we can see that $AP \perp BP$ and thus, $m_{AP}. m_{BP} = -1$.
Which is,
$$\left( \frac{ y - y_{1} }{ x - x_{1} } \right) \left( \frac{ y - y_{2} }{ x - x_{2} } \right) = -1$$

$$(x - x_{1})(x - x_{2}) + (y - y_{1})(y - y_{2}) = 0$$

##### Some Important Points 
The above circle will be smallest possible circle passing through A and B.

If we take two points as $C:(x_{1},y_{2})$ and $D:(x_{2},y_{1})$, then those two points will also be ends of another diameter of the same circle. 

The equation can be treated as sum  of two quadratic equations, in variables x and y having same leading coefficient and having roots as x-coordinates (abscissae) and y-coordinates (ordinates) of ends of a diameter. 

$$(x - x_{1})(x - x_{2}) = 0$$
which has roots $x_{1}, x_{2}$.

$$(y - y_{1})(y - y_{2}) = 0$$
which has roots $y_{1}, y_{2}$.

This result can be used to quickly solve some questions,
