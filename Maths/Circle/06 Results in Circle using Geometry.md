# Results of Circle using Geometry 
#### Line and Circle 
If a line L and a circle C are given then to find whether the line touches or cuts the circle find length of perpendicular (p) from centre of the circle to L. 
- If p > r, then the circle cuts the circle 
- If p = r, then the line will touch, i.e. the line will be tangent to the circle. This is called **Tangency Condition**
- If p < r, then the circle does not touch or cut the circle.

#### Chord Length 
Length of the chord intercepted on line L by circle K will be,
$$AB = 2AM$$
$$AB = 2\sqrt{ r^{2} - p^{2} }$$

In chord length questions, we try to use geometry as much as possible,

[[02 Location of a Point wrt Circle]]

From a point outside the circle K,
$$K \equiv x^{2} + y^{2} + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0$$

$$
\begin{split}
PN_{1} = PN_{2} &= \sqrt{ PC^{2} - r^{2} } \\
&= \sqrt{ (g+h)^{2} + (f+k)^{2} - (g^{2} + f^{2} - c) } \\
&= \sqrt{ h^{2} + k^{2} + 2gh + 2f k + c } \\
&= \sqrt{ K(P) } \\
&= \sqrt{ K(h,k) } \\
&= \sqrt{ S_{p} }
\end{split}
$$
Before putting the point into the equation of circle, we make the coefficients of $x^{2}$ and $y^{2}$ = 1.

#### Variable Chord making Constant Angle
If a variable chord makes a constant angle ($\theta$) at centre of the circle, then locus of mid point of the chord will be a concentric circle with radius $\displaystyle r\cos \frac{\theta}{2}$

#### Tangent including a Constant Angle from a variable Point
If a variable point P is such that tangents drawn from it to a fixed circle includes a constant angle $\theta$, then locus of P will be a concentric circle with radius $\displaystyle r\csc \frac{\theta}{2}$.

In particular, if $\theta = 90^{\circ}$ then locus of P is called **Director Circle** with radius $r\sqrt{ 2 }$.

#### Properties of Shapes formed by Tangents
Let tangents are drawn from P to a given circle ang let length of tangent from P $= l = \sqrt{ S_{p} }$.  

$$
\begin{split}
\text{In OBP}, \\
OP &= \sqrt{ r^{2} + l^{2} } \\
\tan \theta &= \frac{ r }{ l } \\
\sin \theta &= \frac{ r }{ \sqrt{ r^{2} + l^{2} } } \\
\cos \theta &= \frac{ l }{ \sqrt{ r^{2} + l^{2} } }
\end{split}
$$

Now, Chord of contact AB,
$$AB = 2BQ = 2l\sin \theta = \frac{ 2lr }{ \sqrt{ r^{2} + l^{2} } }$$

Angle between the tangents,
$$2\theta = 2 \tan ^{-1} \frac{ r }{ l } = 2 \sin ^{-1} \frac{ r }{ \sqrt{ r^{2} + l^{2} } }$$

Areas,
$$Ar(OAPB) = 2. \frac{ 1 }{ 2 } rl = r.l$$
Triangle formed by tangents and chord of contact of point P,
$$Ar(PAB) = \frac{ 1 }{ 2 } AB . PQ = \frac{ l^{3}r }{ r^{2} + l^{2} }$$
Triangle formed by removing the above triangle,
$$Ar(OAB) = lr - \frac{ l^{3}r }{ r^{2} + l^{2} } = \frac{ r^{3}l }{ r^{2} + l^{2} }$$

And points O,B,P,A are concyclic with diameter OP.
