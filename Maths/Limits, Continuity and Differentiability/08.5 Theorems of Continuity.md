# Theorems of Continuity

Let two functions be $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. We discuss the continuity at $x = c$.

D means discontinuous and C means continuous. 


| $$f(x)$$ | $$g(x)$$ | $$f(x) \pm g(x)$$ | $$f(x) . g(x)$$ | $$\frac{ f(x) }{ g(x) }$$ |
| -------- | -------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| C        | C        | C                 | C               | C, if $g(c) \neq 0$                         |
| C        | D        | D                 | -               | -                         |
| D        | D        | -                 | -               | -                         |

If $f$ and $g$ are continuous is R, then $fog$ and $gof$ will also be continuous in R. 

#### Continuous times Discontinuous 

If at $x = a$ $f(x)$ is *continuous* with LHL, RHL and $f(a)$ as $l$ and $g(x)$ is *discontinuous* at $x = a$ with LHL, RHL and $g(a)$ as $l_{1},l_{2},l_{3}$ (all finite) then t $x = a$ the product function $h(x) = f(x).g(x)$ will be,
1. **Discontinuous** if $l \neq 0$
2. **Continuous** if $l = 0$.

#### Continuous in a Range 

Let $f(x)$ is continuous in [a,b] then 
- It will be bounded (range will not have $\pm \infty$)
- Its maximum and minimum value will exist (say M and m). 
- Range will also be defined in closed interval i.e. range will be $[M,m]$.
- All values between m and M are obtainable or, for every $k \in [m,M]$ there exist a number $c \in [a,b]$ such that $f(c) = k$.

If $f(x)$ is continuous in $[a,b]$ then for every $k \in [f(a), f(b)]$ there exist a number $c \in [a,b]$ such that $f(c) = k$. 

$$or$$

If $f(x)$ is continuous in $[a,b]$ then for any $\lambda,\mu \in R^{+}$ there exist a number $c \in [a,b]$ such that $f(c) = \displaystyle \frac{ \lambda f(a) + \mu f(k) }{ \lambda + \mu }$ (since $\lambda,\mu$ are +ve, this is internal division).

#### Intermediate Mean Value Theorem (IMVT)
If $f(x)$ is continuous in $[a,b]$ then there exist a number $c \in [a,b]$ such that,
$$f(c) = \frac{ f(a) + f(b) }{ 2 }$$

c may be equal to a and b as well.

And, $f(a) \neq f(b) \implies c \in (a,b)$ i.e. strictly in between a and b.

Number of c's which can be obtained can not be given by just application of IMVT. 

The location of c in the interval cannot be determined using this theorem alone. 

#### Continuity of Various Functions

| Function                                                                                                           | Continuity                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| $\sin x$, $\cos x$, $\tan ^{-1}x$, $\cot ^{-1}x$, $a^{x}$, $e^{ x }$, any polynomial, $abs(x)$, $\sqrt[2n+1]{ x }$ | Continuous in R                     |
| $[x], \{ x \}$                                                                                                     | Discontinuous at x = I              |
| $\tan x, \sec x$                                                                                                   | Discontinuous at $x = (2n+1)\pi /2$ |
| $sgn(x)$, $1 /x^{2}$, $1 /x^{n}$, $1 /\sqrt[2n+1]{ x }$                                                            | Discontinuous at x = 0              |

The graphs of $\ln x, \log_{a} x, \sqrt[2n]{ x }, 1 /\sqrt[2n]{ x }, \sin ^{-1}x, \cos ^{-1}x$ will be continuous in  their domains. 

#### Points to Check Continuity 
To discuss continuity of a function, verify continuity at each point wherever,
1. One of the involved expression is undefined or discontinuous.
2. Points where function changes their definition. 

For continuity of $\{ f(x) \} \ \&\ [f(x)]$ check the points where $f(x)$ becomes Integer.
For $sgn(x)$ check points where $f(x)=0$

### Theorem of Continuity 
#important 

If $f(x)$ is *continuous* function in $[a,b]$ and if *$f(a).f(b) < 0$* then there exist a root of the equation $f(x) = 0$ in $(a,b)$ i.e. there exist a number $c \in (a,b)$ such that $f(c) = 0$.

If $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ are of same sign, then there may or may not be a root between a and b.

![[Pasted image 20230811114503.png]]

For a polynomial function $p(x)$,
1. If $p(a).p(b)< 0$ then there exist odd number of real roots in $(a,b)$
1. If $p(a).p(b) > 0$ then there exist even number of real roots in $(a,b)$ (number of roots may be 0 also).

To show  that $f(x) = g(x)$ has a root in $(a,b)$ we do the following,
1. Consider $h(x) = f(x) - g(x)$.
2. Calculate $h(a),h(b)$. 
3. If $h(a)$ and $h(b)$ are of opposite sign and if $h(x)$ is continuous, then using TOC, there exist a root between $(a,b)$.
