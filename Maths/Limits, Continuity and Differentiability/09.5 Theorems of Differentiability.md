### Differentiability of Modulus
#theorem
If $f(x)$ is *continuous and differentiable* function then $y = |f(x)|$ my or may not be differentiable, we need to check only those points where $f(x)= 0$. 
If at those points $f'(x)$ is also 0, then $y = |f(x)|$ will be differentiable at that point otherwise non-differentiable.

This works because if $f'(x) = 0$ it means that when the function touches the x axis, it makes a horizontal tangent. Otherwise, it means that the graph cuts the x axis and the mod forces it back up making a corner.

### Differentiable times Non Differentiable
#theorem 
Let $h(x) = f(x).g(x)$
And at x = a, $f(x)$ is continuous and differentiable. 
$g(x)$ is continuous and non-differentiable.
Then at $x =a$, $h(x)$ will be
1. Differentiable if $f(a) = 0$. 
3. Non-Differentiable if $f(a) \neq 0$.

[[08.5 Theorems of Continuity#Continuous times Discontinuous]]

One way to remember it is,
$$
\begin{split}
h &= f.g \\
h' &= f'.g + g'.f
\end{split}
$$
Now $f'$ exists as f is differentiable. $g'$ will not exist as g is not differentiable thus if $f(a)$ is zero, this term will vanish.

### Some Points to Remember

1. If function has sharp corner at $x = a$ then it is not differentiable at that point. 
1. If it says that the function is differentiable at a point then check the continuity and then differentiate the function. 
2. Do not check differentiability by making graph (as presence or absence of corner may be vague). Thus unless it is absolutely certain that there will be a corner, we cannot say anything about differentiability. 


To check differentiability at x = a,
- Check continuity first.
- Differentiate the expression and substitute x = a.
- If value is obtained, then the obtained value will be $f'(a)$.
- If value becomes undefined, find limiting value of $f'(x)$ at a.
   - If limiting value exists, then the obtained value will be $f'(a)$.
   - If limiting value does not exist, then function is non-differentiable at x = a.
   - If limit does not exist due to fluctuation, discard this method and use first principle (LHD & RHD). 

We can do this because if function is continuous the limit,
$$\lim_{ x \to a } \frac{ f(x) - f(a) }{ x - a }$$
will be of the form 0/0 and thus we can use [[04 Methods of Evaluation of Limits#L' HÃ´pital's Rule (LH Rule)|LH Rule.]] 

Using differentiation using differentiability may or may not reduce calculations depending on question.
