# AM, GM, HM Inequality 
Let 
$$a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},a_{4} \dots a_{n}$$
are n **positive** numbers.
then,
$$AM = \frac{ \sum a_{1} }{ n }$$
$$GM = \left( \prod a_{1} \right)^{1/n}$$
$$HM = \frac{ n }{ \displaystyle  \sum \frac{ 1 }{ a_{1} } }$$
Now we always have,
$$AM \geq GM \geq HM$$
equality holds when all the numbers are equal

To identify a question with AM, GM and HM, see if all the numbers are positive and if we have to find max or min value.

If the expression contains the variable terms whose product or sum is constant, then we can think of using AM GM. I.e. if variable terms is present with its reciprocal in sum form then we can use AM GM

Proof for two numbers $a, b \in R^{+}$,
$$
\begin{split}
(\sqrt{ a } - \sqrt{ b })^{2} &\geq 0 \\
a+b &\geq 2\sqrt{ ab } \\
\frac{ a+b }{ 2 } &\geq \sqrt{ ab } \\ \\
\text{Putting } a = \frac{ 1 }{ x }, b = \frac{ 1 }{ y }, \\
\frac{ \displaystyle  \frac{ 1 }{ x } + \frac{ 1 }{ y } }{ 2 } &
\geq \frac{ 1 }{ \sqrt{ xy } } \\
\sqrt{ xy } &\geq \frac{ 2 }{ \displaystyle \frac{1}{x} + \frac{ 1 }{ y } }
\end{split}
$$

Let a, b, c are +ve, then,
$$a+b+c \geq 3\sqrt[3]{ abc }$$

#### Points to Remember
1. This can only be applied on +ve numbers.
	$\\$	
2. Equality holds iff all the numbers are equal. 
	$$AM = GM = HM = \lambda$$
	if all numbers are equal to $\lambda$
	$\\$	
3. If we are using AM GM to find range or max/min value of some expression then before giving bound check whether on which AM GM is applied can be equal or not. 
	$\\$	

4. If there are more than one independent variables in the expression, min or max value of which is to be found then most probably, the question will be solved using AM-GM. 
	$\\$	

5. In question contains sum and product of variables, then AM GM may be used. 
	$\\$	

1. If numbers and their reciprocals are involved then we can think of applying $AM \geq HM$, 

### Examples
In this question we use the inequality $D \geq 0$, since the range of $\tan \phi$ is R.

In this question since it's not said that the numbers are +ve, we used sum of 3 squares inequality, twice.

We might have to apply AM GM twice and  then multiply them, since all the numbers are +ve.

Since all the quantities are +ve, we can do everything, like cross multiply,

Examples where the product is constant,

If the terms can be both +ve and -ve, but the function is [[00.3 Even & Odd|odd]], we can use AM GM on the +ve side and then negate it for the whole range,

Sometimes we may have to break a number into multiple parts and then apply AM GM,

(in iv, if we break 8/$x^{2}$ in any other way, the equality will not hold and thus the min value of  expression will not come)

In some questions we convert trig functions to tan and cot and then apply AM GM,

In conjecture with [[09 Theory of Equation|theory of equation]],

We apply AM GM inequality on the expression we want to find the min or max value of,

Sometimes we break one of the terms into two,

To prove some inequalities we add multiple, and sometimes apply AM HM,

In triangle inequality we use Heron's formula,

($\Delta$ here is area)

We can multiply inequalities also,
