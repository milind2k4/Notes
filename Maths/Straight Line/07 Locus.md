# Locus
Locus of a variable point is the curve (or its equation) which is traced by it while moving under some condition(s). It could also be a point if the point does not move, or the x-y plane if it is free to move any way possible. 

Procedure to find locus,
1. Assume point as $(h,k)$, locus of which is to be found. 
2. Introduce parameters if needed and keep them minimum 
3. Eliminate the parameters using given information in the question. 
4. The eliminant (the equation after elimination) in h or in k or in both will give required locus after replacing h, k with x, y. 

#### Some points to Remember
1. Keep number of parameters minimum.
2. Try to think the approach to the question from the point (locus of which is required).
3. If at any stage, an equation is obtained in h or in k or in both, then simply stop. This will be the locus. 
4. If we have 3 unknowns which are to be eliminated, then try to form 4 equations to eliminate them. In some cases unknown can be eliminated even if number of equations are lesser than required.

Alternatively, by directly using the point,

Another way of doing this question is using the properties of rectangles,

We can also solve questions easily by simple observation.

Sometimes the most obvious method is the most calculation intensive,

We can do this question using properties of triangles, which is much faster,

In some questions, we need to take parameters,
