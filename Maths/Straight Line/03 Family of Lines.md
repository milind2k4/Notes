# Family of Lines
( #removed from jee 24)

A collection of lines which have similar properties (like slope, point of intersection etc.)

Family of Lines concept is used to reduce calculations.

For example, ($\lambda$ and $m$ are parameters)
Family of lines with slope a can be given as,
$$y = ax + \lambda$$

Family of lines with x intercept a can be given as,
$$\frac{ x }{ a } + \frac{ y }{ \lambda } = 1$$

Family of line which passes through a fixed point, $A:(x_{1},y_{1})$ can be given as,
$$y - y_{1} = m(x - x_{1})$$


#### Lines Passing through Intersection of Two Lines
Family of Lines passing through point of intersection of $L_{1} = 0$ and $L_{2} = 0$ can be given as,
$$L_{1} + \lambda L_{2} = 0$$
This equation removes the step of finding their intersection.
From this equation we can get all lines passing though POI except $L_{2}$.  In questions this is indicated by an absurd result obtained while solving.

If a variable line passes through a single point, then the coefficients of the variables will be in a linear relation. 
I.e. if we need to prove that SL $ax + by + c = 0$ passes through a fixed point, then try to get a linear relation in a, b, c and then make constant terms the same as in the original equation of line. 
The numbers written in place of x and y will give coordinates of fixed point.
