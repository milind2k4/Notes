AB of a pair of straight lines is the locus of a point which is equidistant from both the lines. 

Hence, let 2 lines 
$$L_{i} = a_{i}x + b_{i}y + c_{i},\ i = 1,2$$

If $P(h,k)$ is equidistant from $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$. 

$$\frac{ |a_{1}h + b_{1}k + c_{1}| }{ \sqrt{ a_{1}^{2} + b_{1}^{2} } } = \frac{ |a_{2}h + b_{2}k + c_{2}| }{ \sqrt{ a_{2}^{2} + b_{2}^{2} } }$$

Giving,
$$\frac{ a_{1}x + b_{1}y + c_{1} }{ \sqrt{ a_{1}^{2} + b_{1}^{2} } } = \pm\frac{ a_{2}x + b_{2}y + c_{2}| }{ \sqrt{ a_{2}^{2} + b_{2}^{2} } }$$

$$\frac{ L_{1} }{ \sqrt{ a_{1}^{2} + b_{1}^{2} } } = \pm \frac{ L_{2} }{ \sqrt{ a_{2}^{2} + b_{2}^{2} } }$$

As locus is linear equation in x and y (for both + and - sign) hence AB will be a pair of straight lines. 

As equation can be expressed in the form $L_{1} + \lambda L_{2} = 0$ where 
$$\lambda = \pm\frac{ \sqrt{ a_{1}^{2} + b_{1}^{2} } }{ \sqrt{ a_{2}^{2} + b_{2}^{2} } }$$
hence ABs will pass through point of intersection of the two lines. 

The "angle" part in AB is actually the derived part.

ABs will bisect the angles between the lines. 

The AB are always perpendicular to each other. 

For any point on any of the lines (except the POI) distance from obtuse angular bisector will be more than the distance from acute angular bisector.

In general, two lines are not ABs of their own ABs. But if they are perpendicular to each other, then they are bisectors of their bisectors.

If a line L makes equal angles with $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ then L must be parallel to one of the angular bisectors of $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$. #important

Take same sign as that of $a_{1}a_{2} + b_{1}b_{2}$ for obtuse angular bisector. If $a_{1}a_{2} + b_{1}b_{2} = 0$, then the lines are mutually perpendicular. 

To identify the bisector of the region in which point P lies, take same sign as that of $L_{1}(P) . L_{2}(P)$ in the equation of angular bisector.

If line $L_{1}$ or $L_{2}$ makes angle $\theta$ with AB $B_{1}$, then $B_{1}$ will be acute AB if $|\tan \theta| < 1$ and $B_{1}$ will be obtuse angular bisector if $|\tan \theta| > 1$.
