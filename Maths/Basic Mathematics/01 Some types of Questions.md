# Some types of Questions

## Division Addition Repetition

Questions of the type:

$$a + \frac{1}{b+\displaystyle \frac{1}{c+\displaystyle \frac{1}{d+\displaystyle \frac{1}{e+...\infty }}}}$$

In these questions, we need to find where the repetition starts. Then put $y =$ that repetition.

i.e. assuming repetition starts from $c,$
$$a + \frac{1}{b+\displaystyle \frac{1}{c+\displaystyle \frac{1}{a+\displaystyle \frac{1}{b+...\infty }}}}$$
$$y = a + \frac{1}{b+\displaystyle \frac{1}{c+\displaystyle \frac{1}{y}}}$$

Then solve for $y$ and discard -ve results, if any.

## Finding Minimum Value
If it is given that the variable is more than 0, and there are 2 terms in the expression. 

Use $AM \geq GM$ inequality. 

## Does not Depend on $f(x)$

A condition is given in $f(x)$ (like $f(x) + f(x+1) = 2$), and the value of some expression of $f(x)$ is asked. 

Take $f(x) = 1$. Because if the value of expression depends upon $f(x)$ then the value will not be valid in every case of $f(x)$. 

## Mean, New Mean and the Value of Newly Added Term
The mean and the number of terms is given, some number is removed from it, a new number is added, and the new mean is given. We have to find the new number.

1. Find sum of the terms
$$\sum x = \bar{x} \times n$$

2. Remove the number,
   $$\sum x - c$$

3. Add the new number,
$$\sum x - c + y$$

3. Find new mean,
$$\bar{x}_{new} = \frac{ \sum x - c + y }{ n }$$

4. Solve and find $y$

## Some Manipulations

- Some questions are solved by hit and trial,

- In some questions we might need to add some terms, in that case we try to make the denominator the same.

## Reciprocals
When variables are in power, then the bases may be reciprocals of each other if they are irrational.

## Sum or Product is the Same

If there are 4 factors in the question, we club those whose sum of constant terms is the same.

Similarly, it could also be that the product is the same,

## Symmetric Coefficients
If the question has equal coefficients placed symmetrically from both sides, then it can be turned into a polynomial of $\displaystyle x + \frac{1}{x}$.

For odd degree equations,  $x=-1$ will be a root in our syllabus.
