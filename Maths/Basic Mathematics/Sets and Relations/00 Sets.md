# Sets
Set is a well defined collection of objects.

- $\in$ is used to denote "element present in a set".

Sets are represented using [  ] (  ), {  }. 

{  } means Discrete set. Eg. {1, 2, 3, 4} $\to$ 4 elements.

(  ) & [  ] means Continuous Set. 
- $[a, b]$ $\to$ all numbers b/w a & b and also a & b
- $(a, b)$ $\to$ all numbers b/w $a$ & $b$ (i.e. excluding $a$ & $b$)
- We can also use "\[" in place of "(", i.e. $(a,b) \equiv\ ]a,b[$
- $[a, b)$ $\to$ all numbers b/w $a$ & $b$ including $a$
- [  ] means filled circle, (  ) means open circle and { } means point circles.

[ } is meaningless.

**Cardinality:** The number of elements in a set. Denoted by $n(A)$ (aka *Cardinal Number*)

### Representation of Sets
#### Roster or Tabular Form
When each element is written inside { }.

#### Set Builder or Property Form
Where each element is defined using it's properties. 

E.g. $A = \{ x: x^{2}-4 = 0 \}$
Here, $A = \{ -2,2 \}$

$$\ce{ Set = \{ element: property \} }$$
All elements are in the set which satisfy the property. 

### Different Sets which are Commonly Used

Set of Natural Numbers : 
$$\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \dots\} \to N = I^{+}$$
i.e. set of positive integers

Set of Whole Numbers,
$$\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \dots\} \to W = I^{+} \cup \{0\}$$
i.e. set of non-negative integers.

Set of Integers,
$$\{\dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\} \to I \ or \ Z$$

Set of Real Numbers,
$$(-\infty , \infty) \to R$$

Set of Positive Real Numbers,
$$(0 , \infty) \to R^+$$

Set of Negative Real Numbers,
$$(-\infty , 0) \to R^{-}$$

Set of Rational Numbers,
$$\left\{x \ | \ x = \frac{p}{q}, \ p,q \in I \ and \ q \neq 0 \right\} \to Q$$

Set of Irrational Numbers,
$$Q^{c} = \bar{Q} \ or \ R - Q$$


### Universal Set
Denoted by $U$

A set containing all possible elements in a given context.
$$or$$
Every set under consideration is subset of $U$


## Types of Set
1. **Null/Empty Set:** $\{  \} = \phi$
2. **Singleton Set:** $n(A) = 1$
3. **Finite Set:** $n(A) \neq \infty$
1. **Infinite Set:** $n(A) = \infty$
2. **Equal Sets:** A and B are said to be equal if they have the exact same elements. 
   Each element of A is also an element of B and each element of B is also an element of A. 
   If A and B are subsets of each other.
3. **Equivalent Sets:** If A and B have the same number of elements. All equal sets are equivalent sets. 

## Question Solving
Generally, to solve questions related to sets, make Venn diagrams, Label the regions and write the information given in terms of the regions,
