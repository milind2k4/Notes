# Algebraic Inequalities
Solving an Algebraic Inequality when RHS = 0 and **inequality contains factors of the form $(x\pm a)^k$.**

1. Write the terms in inequality in std. form, i.e. $x\pm a$
2. If there is a $-ve$ sign, then remove it.

3. Plot all roots corresponding to each liner term on the number line, in sequence.

4. Put a cross sign at each root with even exponent in inequality.

5. Put a $+ve$ side on the RHS of the greatest root.

6. Now alter sign while moving towards left except the one corresponding to the cross.

7. Check the direction of inequality and write answer.

8. Check the domain. The solution should lie inside the domains of both sides. 

Note: If only 2 linear factors are present, then the expression is -ve between roots, +ve outside the roots.
