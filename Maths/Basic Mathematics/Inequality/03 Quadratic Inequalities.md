# Quadratic Inequalities
**if inequality contains a quadratic factor $ax^2+bx+c$**

1. Remove $a$ 
   - the quadratic  will become: $x^2+\alpha x +\beta$, 
	 - (where $\displaystyle \alpha = \frac{b}{a} \ and \ \beta =\frac{c}{a}$) 

2. Find $D$ (for $x^2+\alpha x +\beta$)
   - if $D\geq0$ , then roots will be real, say $k_{1}\ and\ k_2$ and quadratic can be written as $(x-k_1)(x-k_2)$
   - if $D<0$ , then roots will be imaginary then roots will be imaginary and in that case $x^2+\alpha x +\beta$ will always be $+ve$ and we can remove the factor by dividing both sides by $x^2+\alpha x +\beta$ 

3. Solve like [[01 Algebraic Inequalities]].

**Note:** If in a quadratic equation, the coefficient of $x^2$ is $+ve$, then the quadratic expression is $-ve$ between the roots and $+ve$ outside them.  (this also works for linear upon linear equations)
