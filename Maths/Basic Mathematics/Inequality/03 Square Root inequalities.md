### Some Properties of Square Root

  - For $\sqrt{A}$ to be defined, $A \geq 0$.

- $\sqrt{A}\geq 0$ always.

- If $A$ and $B$ are both +ve, then $A>B \implies A^{2}>B^{2}$

- If $A$ and $B$ are both -ve, then $A>B \implies A^{2}<B^{2}$

- If $A$ is +ve and $B$ is -ve, then squaring cannot be done. 

## Solving Square Root inequalities

1. Find Domain of the expression (solve $A \geq 0$)

1. Remove $\sqrt{\; }$ by  squaring both sides if both sides are $+ve$.

1. Solve Obtained Inequality like  [[01 Algebraic Inequalities]]

1. For final solution, take intersection of the solution obtained above with the Domain.  


### Questions
In case there is a term on one side which changes sign, we divide the question into cases,

In case there are two sq. roots, try to make the thing inside the outermost sq. root a perfect square. For example,
