# Measures of Deviation
aka. **Dispersion**
Measurement of scattering or compactness. 
How consistent the data is.  

### Range
Spread of data.
The difference between the highest and the lowest value. 

$$\ce{ Range = H - L }$$

### Mean Deviation
The average of the deviation about a [[00 Statistics#Measures of Central Tendency|central tendency.]]

$$\text{MD} =  \frac{ \sum  |x_{i} - A| }{ n }$$
where A is the average about which the deviation is to be calculated. 

If it is not stated about which central tendency we have to calculate the mean, we take A to be mean. 

Thus, mean deviation about median,
$$\text{MD} =  \frac{\sum  |x_{i} - M| }{ n }$$

Thus, mean deviation about mean,
$$\text{MD} =  \frac{\sum  |x_{i} - \bar{x}| }{ n }$$


### [[03.5 Variance and Standard Deviation]]

## Coefficients of Deviation
Sometimes, only measure of deviation is not enough. We also need to know the magnitude of the data. 

The lower the better, and the more consistent. 
#### Coefficient of Range
$$\ce{ coefficient of range = \frac{ H-L }{ H +L } }$$

This is used to compare two data sets. 
It is likely that two data sets will have the same range, but it is unlikely that they have the same coefficient. 

The coefficient tells us the consistency of data. The lower it is  the more consistent the data is. 

The bigger the magnitude, the bigger the denominator. 

#### Coefficient of Mean Deviation

$$\ce{ coefficient of mean deviation = \frac{ MD about A }{ A } }$$

#### Coefficient of SD and Variance

$$\ce{ coefficient of SD = \frac{ \sigma  }{ \bar{x} } }$$
where,
$\sigma \to$ standard deviation
$\bar{x} \to$ mean

$$\ce{ coefficient of variance = \frac{ \sigma  }{ \bar{x} } \times 100 } \%$$

If nothing is said and we are asked to find which data is more consistent, we calculate the coefficient of SD.
