# Line and Hyperbola 
Just like ellipse or parabola. 

Solving the line and hyperbola will give a 2 degree equation. 

For this quadratic equation, 
- If D < 0, the line will not cut HB.
- If D > 0, the line will be chord. 
- If D = 0, the line will be tangent. 
  Here the tangency condition comes out to be,
  $$c^{2} = a^{2}m^{2} - b^{2}$$

#### Tangents 
Equation of tangent with slope m,
$$y = mx \pm \sqrt{ a^{2}m^{2} - b^{2} }$$
For real tangent,
$$a^{2}m^{2} > m^{2} \implies |m| > \frac{ b }{ a }$$

This can be seen as the asymptotes have slope $\pm b /a$. Thus the slope of line should not be between them.

From this result, we can see that there will be no common tangent between a hyperbola and its conjugate hyperbola. 

To write equation of tangent for a vertical HB, i.e.
$$\frac{ y^{2} }{ k^{2} } - \frac{ x^{2} }{ h^{2} } = 1$$
We convert it into standard form,
$$\frac{ x^{2} }{ -h^{2} } - \frac{ y^{2} }{ -k^{2} } = 1$$
And then write equation of tangent,
$$y = mx \pm \sqrt{ -h^{2}m^{2} - (-k^{2}) }$$

If tangent of slope m to HB passes through $(h,k)$ then,
$$(k - mh)^{2} = a^{2}m^{2} - b^{2}$$
$$(h^{2} - a^{2})m^{2} - 2hkm + k^{2} + b^{2}$$

I.e. at most 2 tangents can be drawn from a point to HB.

If the tangents are mutually perpendicular, the points will lies on director circle,
$$x^{2} + y^{2} = a^{2} - b^{2}$$
If $a > b$ there will be infinite points from where we can drawn perpendicular tangents. 
If $a < b$ there will be no point from where we can drawn perpendicular tangents. 

Thus it is possible that a HB may not have a director circle.
