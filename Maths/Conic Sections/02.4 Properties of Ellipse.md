#  Properties of Ellipse 
##### Product of Length of Perpendiculars
Product of length of perpendiculars from foci to any tangent will be $b^{2}$.

Consider a tangent, $y = mx + \sqrt{ a^{2}m^{2} + b^{2} }$
Now the foci are, $S_{1}:(ae, 0), S_{2}:(-ae,0)$

$$
\begin{split}
p_{1} &= \left| \frac{ mae + \sqrt{ a^{2}m^{2} + b^{2} } }{ \sqrt{ 1 + m^{2} } } \right| \\
p_{2} &= \left| \frac{ -mae + \sqrt{ a^{2}m^{2} + b^{2} } }{ \sqrt{ 1 + m^{2} } } \right| \\
\text{Their Product}, \\
p_{1}p_{2} &= \left| \frac{ -m^{2}a^{2}e^{2} + a^{2}m^{2} + b^{2} }{ 1 + m^{2} } \right| \\
&= \left| \frac{ b^{2} + a^{2}m^{2}(1 - e^{2}) }{ 1 + m^{2} } \right| \\
&= \left| \frac{ b^{2} + m^{2} b^{2} }{ 1 + m^{2} } \right| = b^{2}
\end{split}
$$

##### Properties of Auxiliary Circle
Foot of perpendicular from focus to any tangent will lie on auxiliary circle. 

Thus auxiliary circle acts as y axis like in parabola.

Circle drawn on focal radius of any point as diameter will touch auxiliary circle.

##### Properties of Tangent and Chord Segments
Intercepted portion of any tangent between point and directrix will make right angle at corresponding focus.

HM of lengths of segments of any focal chord will be semi-latus rectum. (like parabola)

##### Angular Bisectors 
The tangent and normal will be the angular bisector of the line pair formed by joining any point with the two foci. I.e. angular bisectors of lines $PS_{1},PS_{2}$ will be normal and tangent at P.

##### Reflection Property 
If a light ray originates from any of the foci, then it will pass through other focus after reflection from ellipse.
