# Standard Equation and Terminology
If focus of parabola is $S(a,0)$ and directrix is $L \equiv x + a = 0$, then,

$$
\begin{split}
PS &= PL \\
\sqrt{ (x - a)^{2} + (y - 0)^{2} } &= \frac{ |x+a| }{ \sqrt{ 1^{2} + 0^{2} } } \\
(x-a)^{2} + y^{2} &= (x+a)^{2} \\
y^{2} &= 4ax
\end{split}
$$

Thus the standard equation of parabola is,
$$y^{2} = 4ax,\ (a > 0)$$
and it has focus $S:(a,0)$ and directrix $x = -a$

The line passing through focus and perpendicular to directrix is called **Axis of parabola.** It is also the axis of symmetry. 

The intersection of axis and curve is called **Vertex.**

The intersection of axis and directrix is called **Foot of Directrix.** 

A chord that is perpendicular to axis is called **Double Ordinate.**

The double ordinate passing through focus is called **Latus Rectum. **

Any chord passing through focus is called **Focal Chord.**

Two parabolas are said to be equal if they have LR of equal length. The orientation of parabola do not matter. 

To find the terms, we sometimes will have to use [[00 Straight Line#Shift of Origin]]

In some cases, we will have to manipulate the given equation. We have to be conscious of things like distance formula and length of perpendicular. 

Once we find the focus and directrix, we can find everything else. 

## Various Parabola 
If parabola has axis parallel to y axis, then its equation will be quadratic in x and linear in y. 
$$y = ax^{2} + bx + c$$

If parabola has axis parallel to x axis, then its equation will be quadratic in y and linear in x. 
$$x = ay^{2} + by + c$$

If parabola has axis not parallel to either, then the 2 degree terms will make perfect square and $x^{2},y^{2},xy,x,y$ terms will be present. 


### Other Parabola 
Vertical and horizontal parabola are just like the standard one, just the quadratic term, linear term and the sign of a changes.  

If there is $(y - b)$ and $(x - a)$ type term, then the origin is shifted to $(a,b)$.

### General Parabola  
Below we can see that this is distance from a point = perpendicular distance from a line.
$$
\begin{split}
\sqrt{ (x-a)^{2} + (y-b)^{2} } &= \frac{ |ax + by + c| }{ \sqrt{ a^{2} + b^{2} } } 
\end{split}
$$

Here the directrix is $ax + by + c$ and focus is $(a,b)$.
