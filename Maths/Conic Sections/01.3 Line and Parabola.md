# Line and Parabola 
For intersection of $y = mx + c$ and $y = 4ax$,
$$
\begin{split}
(mx+c)^{2} &= 4ax \\
m^{2}x^{2} + 2(cm - 2a)x + c^{2} &= 0 \\
\text{Now this has,} \\
D &= 4((cm - 2a)^{2} - 4(m^{2}c^{2})) \\
&= 16a (a-cm)
\end{split}
$$

Now, 
- If $D < 0$ there will be no intersection. 
  $\\$
- If $D > 0$ then there will be two distinct intersection point and the line will be chord of parabola.  
	The chord length will be, as $x_{A},x_{B}$ are the roots of the equation, 
	$$
	\begin{split}
	AB &= |x_{A} - x_{B}|\sqrt{ 1 + m^{2} } \\
	&= \frac{ \sqrt{ D } }{ m^{2} }\sqrt{ 1 + m^{2} }
	\end{split} 
	$$
	
- If $D = 0$ then the line is a tangent to the curve. 
  That is,
  $$c = \frac{ a }{ m }$$
  This is the **tangency condition.** 
  
  From this, we can see that,
	$$y = mx + \frac{ a }{ m }$$
	Will always be tangent to the parabola $y^{2} = 4ax$. 


#### Tangents from a point
If a tangent of slope m is drawn from $P:(h,k)$ to the parabola,
$$k = mh + \frac{ a }{ m }$$
(as P satisfies the tangent) 

$$hm^{2} - km + a = 0$$
$m_{1}m_{2} = a /h$ and $m_{1} + m_{2} = k /h$

From here we get two m, $m_{1},m_{2}$. This means that we can at max. draw two tangents from a point.  
- If P is inside, there will be no tangents
- If P is on the parabola, there will be one tangent. 
- if P is outside, there will be two tangents. 

If tangents drawn from point are mutually perpendicular, 
$$
\begin{split}
m_{1}m_{2} &= -1 \\
\frac{ a }{ h } &= -1 \\
h + a &= 0 \\
x + a &= 0
\end{split}
$$
Which is the directrix. Thus the locus of point of intersection of perpendicular tangents is directrix.
