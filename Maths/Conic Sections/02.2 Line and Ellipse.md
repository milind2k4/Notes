# Line and Ellipse 
Let the line is $y = mx + c$. Solving the line with the ellipse will give a 2 degree equation. 

Now if the D of this is -ve then the line and ellipse do not touch. 
If it is +ve then the line is chord. And we can find chord length using,
$$AB = \sqrt{ 1 + m^{2} }|x_{1} - x_{2}|$$
where $x_{1},x_{2}$ are roots of the quadratic formed. 

If it is 0 then the line is tangential. 
The tangency condition in  this case comes out to be,
$$c^{2} = a^{2}m^{2} + b^{2}$$

#### Tangent 
Equation of tangent to ellipse with slope m,
$$y = mx \pm \sqrt{ a^{2}m^{2} + b^{2} }$$
It is valid for both $a > b$ and $a < b$.

If it passes through $(h,k)$, then we get,
$$(h^{2} - a^{2})m^{2} - 2hkm + k^{2} - b^{2} = 0$$
$$m_{1} + m_{2} =\frac{ 2hk }{ h^{2} - a^{2} }$$
$$m_{1}m_{2} = \frac{ k^{2} - b^{2} }{ h^{2} - a^{2} }$$

This means that at most there can be 2 tangents drawn from a point.

Now if the drawn tangents are mutually perpendicular, 
$$
\begin{split}
-1 &= \frac{ y^{2} - b^{2} }{ x^{2} - a^{2} } \\
x^{2} + y^{2} &= a^{2} + b^{2}
\end{split}
$$
This is the equation of the **Director Circle.**
