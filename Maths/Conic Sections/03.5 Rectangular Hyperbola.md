# Rectangular Hyperbola (RHB)
If length of TA = length of CA i.e. a = b.

It has equation,
$$x^{2} - y^{2} = a^{2}$$
The eccentricity becomes $e = \sqrt{ 2 }$.

The POA have slopes $\pm 1$ and are thus mutually perpendicular. 

Its conjugate hyperbola will also be rectangular. 
It is the only case where eccentricities of HB and CHB will be equal.

If axes are rotated through an angle 45$^{\circ}$ in clockwise direction, the hyperbola goes to 1st and 3rd quadrant and its equation becomes,
$$xy = c^{2}$$

Here,
$$a^{2} = 2c^{2}$$

Parametric point on RHB can be taken as,
$$P:\left( ct, \frac{ c }{ t } \right)$$

#### Some Results of RHB

##### Tangent 
- At $(x_{1},y_{1})$,
	$$\frac{ xy_{1} + yx_{1} }{ 2 } = c^{2}$$
	$$\frac{ xy_{1} + yx_{1} }{ 2 } = x_{1}y_{1}$$
	Thus giving,
	$$\frac{ x }{ x_{1} } + \frac{ y }{ y_{1} } = 2$$
	which has slope,
	$$m_{t} = \frac{ -y_{1} }{ x_{1} }$$

- At point $t$,
  $$\frac{ x }{ ct } + \frac{ y }{ c /t } = 2$$
	$$\frac{ x }{ t } + ty = 2c$$


##### Normal
- At $(x_{1},y_{1})$,
	$$y - y_{1} = \frac{ x_{1} }{ y_{1} }(x - x_{1})$$

- At $t$,
	$$y - \frac{ c }{ t } = t^{2} (x - ct)$$



- Let normal at A intersect the HB again at B, then,

	$$
	\begin{split}
	m_{AB} &= m_{AB} \\
	t^{2} &= -\frac{ 1 }{ tt_{1} } \\
	t_{1} &= -\frac{ 1 }{ t^{3} }
	\end{split}
	$$
	thus giving,
	$$B:\left( - \frac{c}{t^{3}}, -ct^{3} \right)$$


##### Chord 

- Equation of Chord joining $t_{1},t_{2}$,
	$$y - \frac{ c }{ t_{1} } = -\frac{ 1 }{ t_{1}t_{2} } (x - ct_{1})$$
	It has slope, 
	$$m = -\frac{ 1 }{ t_{1}t_{2} }$$

- Equation of the chord with mid point as $(x_{1},y_{1})$, 
	$$
	\begin{split}
	T &= S_{1} \\
	\frac{ xy_{1} + yx_{1} }{ 2 } - c^{2} &= x_{1}y_{1} - x^{2} \\
	\frac{ x }{ x_{1} } + \frac{ y }{ y_{1} } &= 2
	\end{split}
	$$
	Which is the same as the equation for tangent. However, there the point was on the HB and here it is not.

#### Some Properties of RHB
Area of triangle AOB is constant and is,
$$Ar(AOB) = 2c^{2}$$

If $t_{1},t_{2},t_{3},t_{4}$ are four concyclic points on the RHB, then
$$t_{1}.t_{2}.t_{3}.t_{4} = 1$$

If P is any point on RHB with centre C and foci $S_{1},S_{2}$ then,
$$CP^{2} = S_{1}P . S_{2}P$$
this result is valid for other hyperbola also.
