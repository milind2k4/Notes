# Conic Sections
 (All tangency conditions are #removed from jee 24)

Conic section is locus of a point P for which ratio of distances from a fixed point S and form a fixed line L is a constant, given that S does not lie on L. This constant is called **Eccentricity.**

The line is called **Directrix** and the point is called **Focus.**
$$\frac{ PS }{ PL } = e$$

If S lies on L, then locus will be [[09 Pair of Straight Lines|pair of straight lines.]] 

If S does not lies on L, then,
- If e = 1, then it is **Parabola.**
- If 0 < e < 1, then it is **Ellipse.**
- If e > 1, then it is **Hyperbola.**

A conic curve will be an equation of 2 degree.
