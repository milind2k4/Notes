# Standard Equation and Terms 
Standard equation is,
$$\frac{ x^{2} }{ a^{2} } + \frac{ y^{2} }{ b^{2} } = 1$$
If a > b then the ellipse will be horizontal. 
If a < b then it will be vertical. 

If the ellipse is either vertical or horizontal, then there will be no term of xy. 

Eccentricity is given as, (if a > b)
$$e^{2} = 1 - \frac{ b^{2} }{ a^{2} }$$
$$a^{2}e^{2} = a^{2} - b^{2}$$
$$b^{2} = a^{2}(1 - e^{2})$$

The foci will have coordinates,
$$S_{1}, S_{2} \equiv (\pm ae, 0)$$

And the directrix will have equations,
$$D_{1},D_{1} \equiv x = \pm \frac{ a }{ e }$$

x-axis is the focal axis, which is called **Major Axis.** The ends of which are $(\pm a,0)$. The length of major axis is $2a$. 

y-axis is called **Minor Axis.** The ends of which are $(\pm b,0)$. The length of minor axis is $2b$. 

Area of an Ellipse is $\pi ab$

The centre is origin. 

The **Latus Rectum** have ends $\displaystyle \left(  \pm ae, \pm\frac{ b^{2} }{ a }\right)$ and length $\displaystyle \frac{2b^{2}}{a}$.

### Some other Definitions 
**Diameter:** Locus of mid point of system of parallel chords. 
Like it was in the case of parabola. 

Like circle, the diameter will pass through centre. 

The diameter will have equation,
$$y = - \frac{ b^{2} }{ a^{2}m }x$$

**Conjugate Diameters:** If $D_{1}$ is diameter of system of chords parallel to $D_{2}$, then $D_{2}$ will be diameter of system of chords parallel to $D_{1}$. $D_{1},D_{2}$ are called conjugate diameters. 

i.e. each will bisect chords parallel to other. 

for conjugate diameters,
$$m_{1}m_{2} = -\frac{ b^{2} }{ a^{2} }$$

Major and minor axis are also conjugate diameters but the product of their slopes is not defined as one of them will be vertical. 

If $D_{1},D_{2}$ are conjugate diameters, then eccentric angles of their end points will differ by 90$^{\circ}$.

## Other Ellipses 
#### Vertical Ellipse 
![[Pasted image 20230919171654.png]]

Major Axis is y axis, minor is x axis. 
Foci are $(0,\pm be)$. 

$$e^{2} = 1 - \frac{ a^{2} }{ b^{2} }$$

Directrices will be $y = \pm b /e$. 
Centre will be origin. 
Ends of minor axis will be $(\pm a, 0)$.
Ends of minor axis will be $(0, \pm b)$,

Length of minor axis will be 2a and that of major axis will be 2b. 

Length of LR will be $2a^{2} /b$

The auxiliary circle will have equation, $x^{2} + y^{2} = b^{2}$.

#### Shifted Ellipse 
The centre shifts to $(h,k)$ and the rest will have to be found wrt this.
