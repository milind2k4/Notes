# Hyperbola 
Hyperbola has two asymptotes and two branches. 

Many results of hyperbola can be obtained from that of ellipse by replacing $b^{2} \to -b^{2}$.

### [[03.1 Std. Equation, terms and Other Hyperbola]]

### Auxiliary Circle and Parametric Point
[[02 Ellipse#Auxiliary Circle and Parametric Point]]

Instead of major axis, we take transverse axis as diameter.

And parametric point will be,
$$P:(a\sec \theta, b\tan \theta)$$
$\theta$ is called eccentric angle. 

### Focal Distances
If P lies on right branch.
$$PS_{1} = ePD_{1} = e\left( x_{P} - \frac{ a }{ e } \right)$$
Thus 
$$PS_{1} = ex_{P} - a$$
Similarly,
$$PS_{1} = ex_{P} + a$$

If P lies on left branch.
$$PS_{1}, PS_{2} = -(ex_{P} \pm a)$$

If point is $\theta$,
$$PS_{1}, PS_{2} = |a(e\sec \theta \pm 1)|$$

Also, difference of the focal distances,
$$|PS_{1} - PS_{2}| = 2a$$
i.e. constant and equal to the transverse axis. 

If P is a variable point and A, B are fixed points such that,
$$|PA - PB| = k\ (const.)$$
then, locus of P will be,
1. *Hyperbola,* if k < AB, where A, B will be foci and k = 2a.
2. *Line AB except points b/w A & B,* if k = AB.
3. *Nothing (i.e. not possible),* if k > AB.

### Equation of Chord and Location of Point
Joining $\theta_{1}$ and $\theta_{2}$. 

$$A:(a \sec \theta_{1}, b\tan \theta_{1})$$
$$A:(a \sec \theta_{2}, b\tan \theta_{2})$$

The middle - becomes + and we interchange the cos terms in the equation of chord from ellipse. 
$$AB = \frac{ x }{ a }\cos \left( \frac{ \theta_{1} - \theta_{2} }{ 2 } \right) - \frac{ y }{ b } \sin \left( \frac{ \theta_{1} + \theta_{2} }{ 2 } \right) = \cos \left( \frac{ \theta_{1} + \theta_{2} }{ 2 } \right)$$

#### Location of a Point wrt Hyperbola 
Like [[02 Location of a Point wrt Circle|circle]]. 
The inside of HB is the region which contains the centre.

### Some other Imp. Properties and Results 
##### Asymptotes and Tangent 
Mid point of intercepted portion of any tangent between asymptotes is bisected at the point of tangency. 
i.e. P is mid point of AB.

The area of triangle formed by any tangent and the two asymptotes is constant, that being,
$$Ar (AOB) = ab$$

##### Perpendicular from Point to Asymptotes 
Product of lengths of perpendiculars from any point on HB to pair of asymptotes will be constant, that being,
$$p_{1} p_{2} = \frac{ a^{2}b^{2} }{ a^{2} + b^{2} }$$

> Proof:
> $$
> \begin{split}
> \text{As P is on HB,} \\
> \frac{ x_{1}^{2} }{ a^{2} } - \frac{ y_{1}^{2} }{ b^{2} } &= 1 \\
> \text{Perp.s from P},\\
> p_{1} &= \frac{ |\frac{x_{1}}{a} - \frac{y_{1}}{b} |  }{ \sqrt{ \frac{1}{a^{2}} + \frac{1}{b^{2}} } } \\
> \\
> p_{2} &= \frac{ |\frac{x_{1}}{a} + \frac{y_{1}}{b} |  }{ \sqrt{ \frac{1}{a^{2}} + \frac{1}{b^{2}} } } \\
> p_{1}p_{2} &= \frac{ | \frac{ x_{1}^{2} }{ a^{2} } - \frac{ y_{1}^{2} }{ b^{2} } | }{ \frac{ 1 }{ a^{2} } + \frac{ 1 }{ b^{2} } } \\
> &= \frac{ a^{2}b^{2} }{ a^{2} + b^{2} }
> \end{split}

##### Foot and Length of perpendicular 
Product of length of perpendicular from foci to any tangent = $b^{2}$.

![[Pasted image 20230920101225.png]]

Foot of perpendicular from either foci to any tangent will lie on auxiliary circle. 

Foot of perpendicular from focus to any asymptote will lies on auxiliary circle as well as directrix. 
$$N:\left( \frac{ a }{ e }, \frac{ b }{ e } \right)$$

##### Angular Bisectors

Angle formed by joining P to the two foci is bisected by tangent at P. 
I.e. $\angle S_{1}PS_{2}$ is bisected by tangent at P.

For any point P, pair of focal distances $PS_{1}$ and $PS_{2}$ will have tangent and normal at P as their angular bisectors.

From this we can see that confocal hyperbola and ellipse intersect at right angles.
