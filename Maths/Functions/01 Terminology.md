# Terminology
- **Domain:**
	- The set of values for which the function is defined.
	- The projection of the graph on the x-axis.
	- The set of all acceptable values of independent variable. 


- **Range:**
	- The set of all obtainable values of the function.
	- The projection of the graph on the y-axis.

- **Root:**
	- Value of $x$ for which $y=0$.
	- The x-coordinate of the points where the graph intersects the x-axis.

- **Min/Max Value:**
	- The min/max value obtainable of $y$.
	- The max/min value in range. 

- **Asymptote:**
	- A straight line, if exists towards which the graph approaches indefinitely.
	- Doesn't exist in every graph..
	- Only exists in graphs which go till $\infty$

- **Boundedness:**
	- A function is said to be bounded if $\exists$ a number $N$ such that $|f(x)| \leq N\ , \forall\ x \in D_f$.
	- Returns *True* or *False*.
	- If function does not have $\pm \infty$ in it's range then it is bounded, 
	- Function should be both upper and lower bounded for it to be bounded. 

- **Increasing/Decreasing:**
	- If value of y increases as x is increased then function is called increasing. 
	- If value of y decreases as x is increased then function is called increasing. 
	- A function can be neither increasing nor decreasing also. 

- **Local Maxima/Minima:**
	- If at $x = \alpha$, the function has local maxima then no value in its proximity will be greater than value of the function at that point. 
	- If at $x = \alpha$, the function has local minima then no value in its proximity will be smaller than value of the function at that point. 
	- There should be a point on the graph for it to be considered as minima and maxima. 
	- The global maxima/minima is one of the local maxima/minima.
	- If a function is not bounded then there will not be any global minima/maxima.
