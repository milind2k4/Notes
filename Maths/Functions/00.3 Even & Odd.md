# Even/Odd
Both are not mutually exclusive, but there is no overlap. I.e. if a function is not even, it need not be odd, and if it is even, then it cannot be odd (except if it is zero). 

A function is **Even** if 
$$f(-x) = f(x),\ x \in D_{f}$$

A function is **Odd** if 
$$f(-x) = -f(x),\ x \in D_{f}$$

if $f(x)$ satisfies none of the above, then it is called neither even nor odd function. (e.g. $e^{ x }$)

To check even/odd/none simply put -x in place of x and if it can be written as $f(x)$ or $-f(x)$, then it is even or odd respectively. 

Try to manipulate the obtained expression so that it can be expressed as $f(x)$ or $-f(x)$. 

If the domain is not symmetric, then it is none. 

Some points to note:
1. We can talk of Even/Odd only if the domain $D = [-a,a]$
	   - Thus if domain is $[-3,4]$ the function is neither odd nor even. 
	- For a function to be classified as even or odd it should be defined in an interval symmetric to origin. 
	$\\$

2. Graph of even function is symmetric about y-axis.
	   - If (a,b) lies on the graph of an even function, then (-a,b) will also lie on the graph.
	$\\$


 1. Graph of odd function is symmetric about origin.
	- If (a,b) lies on the graph of an odd function, then (-a,-b) will also lie on the graph. 
	$\\$

5. If $f(x)$ is an odd function defined at $x=0$ then $f(0)=0$.
	$\\$

7. If $f(x)$ is even as well as odd, then $f(x)=0$, as $y = 0$ is symmetric about y as well as origin. 
   If $f(x) = 0$, then $f(-x) = -f(x) = f(x)$
  $\\$

8. Derivative of an even function will be odd and of an odd function will be even.
   
	Let $f(x)$ be an even function,
	$$
	\begin{split}
	f(-x) &= f(x) \\
	-f'(-x) &= f'(x) \\
	\text{Let,} g(x) = f'(x),\\
	g(-x) &= -g(x) \\
	\\
	\therefore \text{g(x), and thus f'(x) is odd}.
	\end{split}
	$$
	$\\$

1. For an even function if it is differentiable at x = 0, then $f'(0) = 0$.
   $\\$

1. If $f(x)$ is an even function which increases in $[a,b]$ on one side of y axis, then it will decrease in $[-b,-a]$. If it is odd, then it increases in $[-a,-b]$. I.e. monotonic behaviour of an odd function will be the same in the corresponding intervals. 

#### Combination of Two Functions

| $f(x)$ | $g(x)$ | $f(x) \pm g(x)$ | $$f(x)\cdot g(x)\ or\ \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$$ | $f(g(x))\ or\ g(f(x))$ | $f(x)+c$ |
| ------ | ------ | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------- |
| Even   | Even   | Even            | Even                                      | Even                   | Even     |
| Odd    | Odd    | Odd             | Even                                      | Odd                    | None     |
| Even   | Odd    | None            | Odd                                       | Even                   | Even     |
| Odd    | Even   | None            | Odd                                       | Even                   | None     |
(in the last one, $c\neq 0$)

### Even and Odd Extension
Given a part of graph (function) and we have to extend it to make it even or odd. 

If $f(x)$ is defined by expression $g(x)$ on one side of y axis, then its definition on other side of y axis in the corresponding interval will be,
1. $f(x) = g(-x)$ if f is even.
2. $f(x) = -g(-x)$ if f is odd.

If $f(x)$ is any function, then, 
- $f(x) + f(-x)$ will always be even. 
-  $f(x) - f(-x)$ will always be even. 

Any function can be uniquely written as the sum of an even and an odd function.
$$f(x) =  \frac{(f(x)+f(-x)) + (f(x)-f(-x))}{2}$$
