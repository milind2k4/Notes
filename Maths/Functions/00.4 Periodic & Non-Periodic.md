# Periodic/Non-Periodic
Mutually exclusive.

If a graph repeats itself till infinity on both sides then it is called periodic function and the minimum possible length which repeats is called fundamental period. 

If $f(x)$ is periodic, then $\exists$ a non-zero number T such that,
$$f(x + T) = f(x)$$
$|T|$ is called period of the function. 
Fundamental period will be less than or equal to this. 

And,
$$f(x + nT) = f(x)$$
where n is any integer. 

Minimum value of $T$ is called Fundamental period.
It is the least possible length on graph of the function which will be repeating.
Any integral multiple of fundamental period can be called period.

Periodic function having a root will have infinite roots. 

Some periodic functions,

| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| $\sin , \cos, \sec, \csc$                                        | $2\pi$        |

| $\|\sin\| - \|\cos\|$                                            | $\pi$         |
| $\sin ^{2k+1}, \cos ^{2k+1}$                                     | $2\pi$        |

| $\tan ^{2k}, \tan ^{2k+1}, \|\tan\|, \|\cot\|$                   | $\pi$         |
| $\{x\}$                                                          | $1$           |
| Constant $f(x)=k$                                                | Indeterminant |
| $\{ x \}$                                                        | $1$           |


- Squaring (taking even power) or Taking mod of the function halves the f.p.
- Cubing (taking odd power) does not change f.p.

#### Some points to Note

If $f(x)$ is periodic with period $T_{1}$ and $g(x)$ is periodic with period $T_{2}$,
1. Period of $f(x+k), f(x)+k, kf(x), \frac{ 1 }{ f(x) }, \sqrt{ f(x) }$ will have period $T_{1}$. 
2. Period of $f(ax+b)$ will be $\displaystyle \frac{ T_{1} }{ |a| }$. 
1. Period of $f(x) \pm g(x), f(x)g(x), \displaystyle \frac{ f(x) }{ g(x) }$ will be LCM($T_{1},T_{2}$) (if exist)
2. Period of $h(f(x))$ will be $T_{1}$. 
3. $f(h(x))$ will be non-periodic, if $h(x)$ is non-linear and non-periodic. 
   - There are some exceptions.
4. If $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ are fundamental periods, then from above, we will get a period which may or may not be fundamental.

To find the period of $f(x+a) + f(x+b) = f(x+c)+f(x+d)$
- Find the minimum of $a,b,c,d$ and put $x = x+\{min\}$
- Simplify 

- If we find a period and in the answer there is half of that given, we have to check if that is the period also.

To find fp, we need to observe.

Some exceptions to the rules are,
$$\sin(x + \sin(x)) \to 2\pi$$
$$\tan\left( \frac{\pi}{2}[x] \right) \to 2$$
