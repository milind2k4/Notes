# Into/Onto 
- A function $f: A \to B$ is called **Onto (surjective)** if its range is equal to the co-domain. i.e. $R_{f} = B$.
- A functions $f:A \to B$ is called **Into** if its range is a proper subset of co-domain. i.e. $R_{f} \subset B$.
  (at least one element of B does not have a pre-image)

In this classification there is no third case, i.e. "not into" means "onto". 

If $f:A \to B$ then A is domain and B co-domain, but in the absence of such statement take domain as the set of all values where $f$ is defined. In question of Into/Onto co=domain must be given. In case it is not given then take co-domain as $R$. 


To differentiate Into/Onto:
1. Find range.
1. If **range = co-domain** then the function is Onto
1. If **range $\subset$ co-domain** then the function is Into

If $R_{f}$ has an element which is not present in co-domain, then the function is not defined.

### Number of Into/Onto Functions

If $f:A \to B$ and $n(A) = n_{1}, n(B) = n_{2}$ then,
- Total number of Functions: $n_{2}^{n_{1}}$

For number of onto functions, "distributing $n_{1}$ objects among $n_{2}$ persons such that each gets at least one object".

For number of into functions, "distributing $n_{1}$ objects among $n_{2}$ such that at least one person should not get any object." Or we could subtract the number of onto functions from the total number of functions. 

| Case                | TN of $f$       | No. of Onto | No. of Into     |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| $n_{1} = n_{2} = n$ | $n^{n}$         | $n!$        | $n^{n} - n!$    |
| $n_{1}< n_{2}$      | $n_{2}^{n_{1}}$ | 0           | $n_{2}^{n_{1}}$ |
| $n_{1} > n_{2}$     | $n_{2}^{n_{1}}$ | See Below   | See Below       |

When $n_{1} > n_{2}$, 
number of onto functions,
$$N  = n_{2}^{n_{1}} - {}^{n_{2}}C_{1}(n_{2}-1)^{n_{1}} + {}^{n_{2}}C_{2}(n_{2}-2)^{n_{1}} - {}^{n_{2}}C_{3}(n_{2}-3)^{n_{1}} + \dots$$
number of into functions,
$$N = {}^{n_{2}}C_{1}(n_{2}-1)^{n_{1}} - {}^{n_{2}}C_{2}(n_{2}-2)^{n_{1}} + {}^{n_{2}}C_{3}(n_{2}-3)^{n_{1}} + \dots$$
