# One-One/Many-One
Both are mutually exclusive. i.e. One-One functions cannot be Many-One. There is no third case. I.e. if a function is not one-one, then it will be many one. 

$$f: \text{Domain} \to \text{Co-domain}$$

A function is said to be **One-One** or **Injective** if no two independent variables have the same value of function. 
No two x have the same y. 
No element of range has more than one pre-image. 
$f(x_{1}) = f(x_{2}) \implies x_{1} = x_{2}$
Graphically, no horizontal line will intersect graph of a one-one function more than once. 

$$f: \text{One} \to \text{One}$$

A function is called **Many-One** if there are at least one pair of independent variable which produce the same value of the function. 
At least two x have the same y. 
At least one element of the range has more than one pre-image. 
$f(x_{1}) = f(x_{2}) \centernot\implies x_{1} = x_{2}$
Graphically, at least one horizontal line will intersect graph of the function more than once. 
$$f: \text{Many} \to \text{One}$$

- All even, periodic, fluctuating and polynomial functions with more than one roots, even degree polynomial, function with turning graph are Many-One. 
	- All odd, non-periodic, non-fluctuating and polynomial functions one root may be Many-One or One-One.
- The graph of a continuous one-one function must be either entirely increasing or entirely decreasing.
- For a differentiable function to be One-One its derivative should not change its sign. Otherwise it's a many one function. 

The concept of one-one and many-one can be used to solve equations also,

### Number of One-One/Many-One Functions
[[00.1 Into & Onto#Number of Into/Onto Functions]]


If $A,B$ are two sets with number of elements $n,m$ then,
- If n < m,
	Number of functions: $n^{m}$
	Number of One-One functions: ${}^{m}C_{n} . n!$
	Number of Many-One functions: $n^{m} - {}^{m}C_{n}. n!$
	$\\$

- If n = m,
	Number of functions: $n^{m}$
	Number of One-One functions: $n!$
	Number of Many-One functions: $n^{m} - n!$
	$\\$

- If n > m,
	Number of functions: $n^{m}$
	Number of  One-One functions: $0$
	Number of Many-One functions: $n^{m}$
