# Quadratic Equations and Expressions
Expressions of the type $ax^{2}+bx+c$ (where $a,b,c$ are constants, which could be imaginary also) are called Quadratic expression in variable $x$ and $a \neq 0$. 

Quadratic Expression equated to $0$ is called Quadratic Equation.

A quadratic equation cannot have more than two values for $x$ for which the equation is satisfied. 

If a question does not say explicitly that the equation given is quadratic, then $a = 0$ is a possibility, and we have to take two cases, one where $a = 0$ and one where $a \neq 0$.

If the equation is satisfied for more than 2 distinct values of $x$, then the equation is not quadratic. 
In this case, $a=b=c=0$
i.e. the equation is $0\cdot x^{2} +0 \cdot x + 0 = 0$
And the equation becomes an identity $0=0$.

- This is valid even if $a,b,c$ are not constant. i.e. it is an identity.
