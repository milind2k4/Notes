# Nature of Roots
$$ax^{2}+bx+c = 0\ (a \neq 0)$$
***Has roots which are,***

**Real** if $b^{2} - 4ac \geq 0$ i.e. $D \geq 0$
- if $D = 0$, then roots will be real and repeated
- if $D > 0$, then roots will be real and distinct $\displaystyle \left( -\frac{b}{2a} \right)$

**Imaginary** if $b^{2} - 4ac < 0$ i.e. $D < 0$

##### Note
- If roots are **Imaginary**, then $a,c$ are of the same sign. The converse is not true.
  - $\text{Imaginary roots } \implies a \cdot c > 0$ (because $b^{2} < 4ac$)
  - $a \cdot c > 0 \centernot\implies \text{Imaginary roots }$ (it could be that $b^{2} > 4ac$)
- If $a,c$ are of opposite signs, then roots are **Real**. The converse is not true.
  - $a \cdot c \leq 0 \implies \text{Real roots }$ (because $b^{2} - 4ac$ becomes $b^2$ or $b^{2} + 4ac$)
  - $\text{Real roots } \centernot\implies a \cdot c \leq 0$ (it could be that $b^{2} > 4ac$)

### Some things to Note

- If the coefficients are real, then the imaginary roots occur in conjugate pairs. 
	- If they are imaginary, then the imaginary roots do not occur in conjugate pairs. 

- If the coefficients are rational, then the irrational roots occur in conjugate pairs. 
	- If they are irrational, then the irrational roots do not occur in conjugate pairs. 

- If the equation is multiplied by a constant, then its roots remain unchanged.

- If $a + b + c = 0$, then one of the roots is $1$.
	- Try to put $-2,-1,+1,+2$ into the equation. 
	  
	  A  theoretical example, here, since $f(x)$ is satisfied for more than 2 values of x, $f(x) \equiv 0$.

- If one root is rational (or real) then the other root will also be rational (or real) (if $a,b,c \in Q\ [or\ R]$)
