# Misc. Points 
##### Collinearity and Coplanarity of Points
Two points are always collinear. 
	Three may or may not be collinear but they will always be coplanar.

If three points are collinear, then there will be infinite planes containing them. 

If 3 points are non collinear then they will lie on a unique plane, which will be the plane of the triangle formed by joining them. 

Four or more points may or may not be collinear or coplanar. 


##### Collinearity and Coplanarity of Vectors
Two free vectors may or may not be collinear, but they will always be coplanar. 
If they are collinear, then they will lie on infinite planes and if they are non collinear then they will lie on a unique plane in the sense of orientation.

Three or more vectors may or may not be coplanar. 

##### Vectors wrt a Line
Parallel to a line, two unit vectors exist. 

Perpendicular to a line, there are infinite unit vectors and all of these lie on a line.

There will be infinite unit vectors which make an angle $\theta (\neq 0^{\circ}, 90^{\circ})$ with a given line and all of them will lie on a conical surface for which the line is axis and semi vertical angle is $\theta$.

##### Vectors wrt a Plane 
Parallel to a plane there will be infinite unit vectors.

Perpendicular to a plane there will be 2 unit vectors.

##### Uniquely determining a Line 
To determine a straight line uniquely in space, we require.
1. Two points on it
2. A point on it and a parallel direction. 
3. A point on it and two perpendicular directions (which are mutually non collinear).

##### Uniquely determining a Plane 
To determine a plane uniquely in space, we require,
1. Three non collinear points on it
2. One point on it and a perpendicular direction. 
3. One point on it and two parallel directions to the plane (which are mutually non collinear)
4. Two points and one parallel direction to the plane.

##### Properties of Two Lines 
In space if two lines $\ce{ L_{1} and L_{2} }$ are given, then they may be,
1. Coincident 
2. Distinct Parallel 
3. Intersecting
4. Skew

Skew lines are non coplanar and in all other cases, they are coplanar. 

##### Properties of Line and Plane 
If L is a line and P is a plane then, 
1. L may lie in P
2. L may be parallel to P but not in it.
3. L may intersect the plane at a point.

##### Properties of Two Planes 
If $\ce{ P_{1} and P_{2} }$ are two planes then they may be,
1. Coincident 
2. Distinct Parallel
3. Intersecting in a line. 

### Linearly Dependent and Independent Vectors 
A set of vectors $\vec{r}_{1}, \vec{r}_{2}, \vec{r}_{3} \dots \vec{r}_{n}$ are called LI if for any equation,
$$\lambda_{1} \vec{r}_{1} + \lambda_{2}\vec{r}_{2} + \lambda_{3} \vec{r}_{3} + \dots \lambda_{n} \vec{r}_{n} = \vec{ 0 }$$
we have,
$$\lambda_{1} = \lambda_{2} = \lambda_{3} = \dots = \lambda_{n} = 0$$

I.e. no vector can be written in terms of any other. 

In maths, in 3D we can have a max of 3 LI vectors. Which will be when those three are non coplanar. 

3 co planar vectors will be LD. 
2 non collinear vectors will be LD. 
2 collinear vectors will be LD.
4 or more vectors will always be LD (when space is 3D).

### Angular Bisectors
If $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ are two given vectors, then, 

The vector which bisects angle between $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ can be taken as, $\hat{a} + \hat{b}$.

The vectors which bisects angle between lines of action of $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ will be along $\pm (\hat{a} + \hat{b})$ and $\pm(\hat{a} - \hat{b})$.

![[Pasted image 20231110100621.png]]

There will be infinite unit vectors which will make equal angles (say $\alpha$) with $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$. All these vectors will lie in a plane $\perp$ to plane of $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ and this plane will contain $\hat{a} + \hat{b}$.

Also,
$$\alpha \in \left[ \frac{ \theta }{ 2 }, \pi - \frac{ \theta }{ 2 } \right] $$
![[Pasted image 20231110101221.png]]

Out of these infinite vectors, two vectors which are along $\hat{a} + \hat{b}$ and along $- (\hat{a} + \hat{b})$ will be co planar with $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$.

All the vectors which are equally inclined with lines of action of $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ will be lying in one of the two planes with normal along $\hat{a} \pm \hat{b}$.

Unit vector along angular bisector of vectors,
$$
\begin{split}
\hat{u} &= \frac{ \hat{a} + \hat{b} }{ |\hat{a} + \hat{b}| } \\
&= \frac{ \hat{a} + \hat{b} }{ \sqrt{ 1 + 1 + 2 \hat{a}.\hat{b} } } \\
&= \frac{ \hat{a} + \hat{b} }{ \sqrt{ 2 + 2\cos \theta } } \\
&= \frac{ \hat{a} + \hat{b} }{ 2 \cos\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) }
\end{split}
$$

Unit vector perpendicular to $\hat{u}$,
$$
\hat{v} = \frac{ \hat{a} - \hat{b} }{ 2 \cos\left( \frac{ \pi - \theta }{ 2 } \right) } 
= \frac{ \hat{a} - \hat{b} }{ 2\sin\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) }
$$

![[Pasted image 20231110102425.png]]

If a direction makes equal angles with $\vec{a},\vec{b},\vec{c}$, then it must be along,
$$(\hat{a} - \hat{b}) \times (\hat{b} - \hat{c})$$
$$\hat{a} \times \hat{b} + \hat{b}\times \hat{c} + \hat{c} \times \hat{a}$$
