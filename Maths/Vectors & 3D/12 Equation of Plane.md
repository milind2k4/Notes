# Equation of plane

### General Form

$$ax + by + cz + d = 0$$
The normal vector of this plane is $\vec{N} = (a,b,c)$.

Any plane parallel to P can be given as:
$$ax + by + cz + d = 0$$

### Intercept Form

$$\frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} + \frac{z}{c} = 1$$
Area of the triangle formed by this plane:
$$\ce{ area } = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{ (ab)^{2} + (bc)^{2} + (ca)^{2} }$$

Volume of Tetrahedron made by the plane and origin
$$\ce{ volume } = \frac{1}{6}|abc|$$

### Vector Form

Plane passing through a point whose position vector is $\vec{a}$ and having normal $\vec{n}$ :

$$(\vec{r} - \vec{a}). \vec{n} = 0$$
This can also be written as,
$$\vec{r}.\vec{n} = q$$
where $q = \vec{a}.\vec{n}$.

#### If 3 points on the plane are given
Plane where 3 points in the plane is given,

$$(\vec{r} - \vec{a}).(\vec{a} \times  \vec{b} + \vec{b} \times \vec{c} + \vec{c} \times \vec{a})$$

#### Conversion to Coordinate Form

In coordinate form, we put $\vec{r} = (x,y,z), \vec{a} = (x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})$ and $\vec{n} = (a,b,c)$ where $(a,b,c)$ are dr parallel to the normal vector. Thus,

$$(x-x_{1}, y-y_{1}, z-z_{1}).(a,b,c) = 0$$
$$a(x-x_{1}) + b(y-y_{1}) + c(z-z_{1}) = 0$$
