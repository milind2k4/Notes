# Integrating by Parts
$$
\begin{split}
(f.g)' &= f'.g + f.g' \\
f.g &= \int f'.g \, dx + \int f.g' \, dx \\
\int f.g' \, dx &= f.g - \int f'.g \, dx 
\end{split}
$$

This can be written as,
$$
\int f.g \, dx = f \int g \, dx - \int f' \cdot ( \smallint g \, dx ) \, dx 
$$

i.e.
$$\int I \cdot II = I ( \smallint II ) - \int I' \cdot (\smallint II)$$

- In by parts we try to generate similar functions for given dissimilar functions.
- For log and inverse most probably, by parts will be used if substitution is not working. 
- While integrating 2nd function we need not write arbitrary constant. 
- If the expressions are of the same type (e.g. both trigonometric), then take the second function the one whose integration is the simplest. 
- If we get stuck, we can reverse the choice of first and second function and try again. 
- After applying by parts, we can use any method to integrate the generated integral. 
- If by parts is applied twice, then choice of 1st and 2nd function should not be altered.

#### How to select first function
$$\underset{\text{preference}}{\underleftarrow{ILATE} }$$
Inverse
Log
Algebraic
Trigonometric
Exponential

The higher on the list, the more preference, i.e. inverse will be preferred over trigonometric as first function, as we choose the function whose integration is hard as first function. 

If there is just one function, multiply it by 1 and take 1 as the 2nd function as we do not know the integrating of the given function as is.

Using it we have some results,
$$
\begin{split}
\int \ln x \, dx &= x\ln x - x + c \\
\int \sin ^{-1}x \, dx &= x\sin ^{-1}x - (1 - x^{2})^{1/2} + c \\
\int \tan ^{-1}x \, dx &= x\tan ^{-1}x - \frac{1}{2} \ln |1+x^{2}| + c \\
\end{split}
$$

#### Applying By Parts Many Times
If we have to apply by parts multiple times, we can use,
$$\int I \cdot II \, dx = I. (\smallint II \, dx) - I' (\smallint\smallint II) + I'' (\smallint\smallint\smallint II) - \dots$$

I.e. keep differentiating the first function and keep integrating the 2nd function until the first function vanishes with alternate +,- signs. 

This will only work if we know all the integrals and all the differentials of the second term.

We will also not use this when the functions in the question interact in the integral generated by using by parts.

### Forcing Integration by Parts 

$$\int  \frac{ f }{ g^{2} } \, dx = \int  \underbrace{ \left( \frac{ f }{ g' } \right) }_{ I } \underbrace{ \left( \frac{ g' }{ g^{2} } \right) }_{ II } \, dx$$
Use by parts.

(here in the 2nd integral there will be $x\sin(x) - \cos(x)$ in both num. and denom.)
