# Relating Integrals
To relate 2 integrals we can,
1. Look for relation between their limits 
2. Get clue from argument of the functions involved. 
3. Look for $f, f'$ pair so that we can apply by parts.

Some general notes for substitution,
$$
\begin{split}
\int_{a}^{1/a} \to x &= \frac{ 1 }{ t } \\
\int_{0}^{\infty} \to x &= \frac{ 1 }{ t } 
\end{split}
$$

## Determination of Function
[[10 Functional Equations]]

1. If integral contains unknown function and the limits are constant, then this integral can be taken as constant $'k'$

2. If integral contains unknown function and the limits contain variables then we need  to differentiate it first to get rid of integrals. We can then integrate after rearranging the terms. I.e. club all the $f'$ terms with $f$.
