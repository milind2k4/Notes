# Detection of Elements
**Lassaigne Extract (LE)/Sodium extract**

$$\ce{ org. compound ->[Na, \Delta] ionic compound ->[test] }$$

On heating, the covalent bonds in the organic compound are broken and Na forms ionic compounds with its constituent atoms.

In the china dish, the solution is heated till its volume becomes 1/3rd of original. 

By doing this Na reacts with various elements to form ionic compounds,

$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
Na + C + N &->[\Delta ] NaCN \\
Na + S &->[\Delta ] Na_{2}S \\
Na + X &-> NaX \\
Na + C + N + S &-> Na(SCN)
 }
\end{split}
$$
Now the Lassaigne solution is tested for these compounds. This therefore gives use the elements present in the original organic compound. 

### Nitrogen
Sodium Cyanide is formed in LE.
The organic compound should have both C and N. Thus hydrazines, Diazonium Salts and $\ce{ NH_{2}OH }$ do not give Lassaigne test.  

$$\ce{ org. compound ->[Na. \Delta ] NaCN ->[FeSO_{4} + H_{2}SO_{4}] Na_{4}[Fe(CN)6] ->[Fe^{3+}] Fe_{4}[Fe(CN)6]_{3} }$$

$\ce{ Fe_{4}[Fe(CN)6]_{3} }$ is called **Ferric Ferrocyanide** and is *Prussian Blue* in colour.
$\ce{ Na_{4}[Fe(CN)6] }$ is called **Sodium Ferrocyanide**


### Sulphur 
#### Sodium Extract Test
Either black or purple ppt is formed depending on the added compound.

#### Oxidation Test
S is oxidised to its max. ON and then barium chloride is added. This forms a white ppt.

### Halogen
#### Sodium Extract Test (Cl, Br, I)
LE is added to concentrated nitric acid then silver nitrate is added. Silver form the silver nitrate forms different coloured ppt depending on the halogen. 

$\ce{ Cl -> White }$
$\ce{ Br -> Pale Yellow }$
$\ce{ I -> Dark Yellow }$

Then the ppt is dissolved in $\ce{ NH_{4}OH }$ ammonia. AgCl is soluble, AgBr is partially soluble and AgI is insoluble.   

Since adding ammonia to water forms ammonium hydroxide, $\ce{ NH_{4}OH }$ is also called ammonia solution. 
$$\ce{ NH_{3} + H_{2}O -> NH_{4}OH }$$

Nitric acid is added because it decomposes $\ce{ NaCN, Na_{2}S }$ . This is done because AgCN and AgS are both white coloured.

#### Beilstein Test
Organic compound is laced on copper wire and then it is burned on burner. If the organic compound has halogen then the copper wire **burns green** due to volatile halide of Cu. 

However, this does not distinguish which halogen is present.

#### Organic Layer Test
Only given by Br and I. 

Organic non polar (like $\ce{ CS_{2}, CCl_{4} }$) solvent is added to LE, then the solution is oxidised by chlorine water or $\ce{ KMnO_{4} }$. 

Bromide is oxidised to bromine. Iodide is oxidised to iodine.

If there is bromine then an orange organic layer is formed. 
If there is iodine then an violet organic layer is formed.

(the organic layer is the one in which the colour is seen)

### Combine test of N and S
Sodium thiocyanate is formed which forms ferric thio cyanate ($\ce{ Fe(CNS)3 }$), a blood red coloured compound.

### Phosphorus
Organic compound is oxidised which converts all the phosphorus into phosphate ($\ce{ PO_{4}^{3-} }$) then nitric acid is added which forms phosphoric acid. Then sodium/ammonium molybdet is added which forms a canary yellow solution.
