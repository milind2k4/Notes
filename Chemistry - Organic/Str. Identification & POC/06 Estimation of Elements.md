# Quantitative Analysis of Elements
$w$ is the weight of organic compound originally taken.

### Estimation of C and H by Liebig's Method
Organic compound is heated in presence of oxygen, and CuO is also present which makes sure that all the organic compound is oxidised  to $\ce{ CO_{2} + H_{2}O }$ and Cu is deposited. 

These gases are then passed through tube of anhydrous $\ce{ CaCl_{2} }$, which is weighed beforehand. This $\ce{ CaCl_{2} }$  absorbs water.

The $\ce{ CO_{2} }$ is passed over KOH and it absorbs it and forms $\ce{ K_{2}CO_{3} + H_{2}O }$ 

Then mass of $\ce{ H_{2}O = (y-x) g }$, giving % H
$$\% H = \frac{ (y-x) \times 2 \times 1  }{ 18 \times w } \times 100$$

And mass of $\ce{ CO_{2} = (b - a) g }$, giving % C,
$$\% C = \frac{ (b-a) \times 1 \times 12 }{ 44 \times w } \times 100$$

### Estimation of Halogen by Carious Method
Carious tube is  50 cm long and 2 cm wide. 

The organic compound is heated in the presence of fuming $\ce{ HNO_{3} + AgNO_{3} }$. The halogen reacts with silver to form ppt. This ppt is then measured, its mass found to be x (say).

Then the percentage of halide,

$$\% Cl = \frac{ x \times 35.5 }{ MW_{AgCl} \times w } \times 100$$
$$\% Br = \frac{ x \times 80 }{ MW_{AgBr} \times w } \times 100$$
$$\% I = \frac{ x \times 127 }{ MW_{AgI} \times w } \times 100$$

### Estimation of Sulphur
The organic compound is oxidised by conc. Nitric acid in the presence of barium chloride. A white ppt of $\ce{ BaSO_{4} }$ is formed. This is measured say x g, and then %S can be calculated. 

$$\% S = \frac{ x \times 32 }{ MW_{BaSO_{4}} \times w } \times 100$$

### Estimation of Nitrogen
#### DUMA's method
The N in the organic compound is converted into $\ce{ N_{2} }$ gas and its volume and thus moles are found.

When the organic compound is heated with CuO, the C get converted to $\ce{ CO_{2} }$, H to $\ce{ H_{2}O }$, and N to $\ce{ N_{2} }$. To collect $\ce{ N_{2} }$, we pass the gases released through KOH.

Nitrogen oxides if formed are converted into $\ce{ N_{2} }$ gas by the Cu in reduced copper gauze. 

At first the nitro meter is fully filled with KOH but after the reaction, nitrogen gas is collected at the top. 

At this point the pressure developed by the nitrogen gas and water vapours is equal to the atmospheric pressure.

Now, (1 is exp and 2 is at stp)
$$
\begin{split}
\frac{ P_{1}V_{1} }{ T_{1} } &= \frac{ P_{2}V_{2} }{ T_{2} } \\
V_{2} &= \frac{ P_{1}V_{1} \times 273 }{ T_{1} \times 760 } \\
\end{split}
$$

Giving, moles of N,
$$n_{N} = \frac{ V_{2} }{ 22400 }$$
Mass of N,
$$m_{N} = \frac{ V_{2} }{ 22400  } \times 28$$

And thus, %N will be,
$$\% N = \frac{ V_{2} \times 14 }{ 22400 \times w } \times 100$$

#### Kjeldahl's Method
The N in the organic compound is converted to ammonia. This ammonia reacts with sulphuric acid becomes $\ce{ (NH_{4})2SO_{4} }$

However, this method is not applicable for nitro group, azo group, when N is present in ring. 

Then the solution is transferred to distillation flask. IN which excess NaOH is added, This releases all the ammonia which is then reacted with sulphuric acid in the conical flask.

Then the solution is titrated with NaOH solution, and we measure the volume needed to reach end point is found. 

Then moles of $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$ remaining is $\displaystyle \frac{ M_{2}V_{2} }{ 2 }$.

The moles reacted with ammonia,
$$\text{moles of } \ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} } = M_{1}V_{1} - \frac{ M_{2}V_{2} }{ 2 }$$

Thus the moles of ammonia evolved or moles of N,
$$2\times \text{moles of } \ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} } \text{ reacted with ammonia }$$

$$\text{moles of } \ce{ N } = 2\left( M_{1}V_{1} - \frac{ M_{2}V_{2} }{ 2 } \right)$$
