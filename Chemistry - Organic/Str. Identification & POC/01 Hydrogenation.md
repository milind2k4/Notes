# Hydrogenation 
of Alkenes and Alkynes

The number of hydrogen attached is equal to the number of pi bonds. 

In presence of metal catalyst, complete hydrogenation takes place on $\ce{ C#C }$. 
Hydrogenation of aromatic ring is done at high temp. as the aromatic ring is very stable and thus does not want to add H.

To identify possible structures of reactants, first find the degree of unsaturation and then draw the structures. In hydrogenation, str. does not change, but it has to have a double or triple bond to get hydrogenized in the first place. 

An sp carbon cannot be formed in small rings (<8). Due to ring strain.
