 | Bromine water Test, $\ce{ Br_{2} + H_{2}O }$ (brown-orange) | Colour Disappears        |


Note: Aniline and Phenol also give bromine water test. 

### Terminal Alkyne
$\ce{ R-C#C-H }$. The terminal C is sp and thus has high EN. Due to this the H gets activated and gives some specific reactions. 

 | Reagent and Test                                                                               | Observation                         |

 | Hydrolysis       | Smell of Ammonia, White Fumes with HCl dipped Glass Rod |



![[Pasted image 20230520193351.png|400]]
This reaction can occur in both acidic and basic medium. Basic is taken here so that ammonia which is basic does not react to form its salt, and is released. 

When a glass rod previously dipped in HCl is placed above the test tube, white fumes are formed.

The colour of complex depend on whether other groups are attached to the ring or not. If only phenol is present then the complex is violet. 

Other than phenol, following groups also give ferric chloride test,
- **Enol** $\ce{ =C=C-OH }$
- **Oxime** $\ce{ =C=N-OH }$
- Hydroxamic acid $\ce{ -CO-NH-OH }$

Isocyanide Test gives a foul smelling compound,
![[Pasted image 20230520211530.png|500]]

Mustard oil test forms black ppt, $\ce{ HgS }$ with $\ce{ HgCl_{2} }$ and isothiocyanate which smells like mustard oil,
![[Pasted image 20230520211835.png]]
Sec. amine does not give test but reacts, and tert. amine does not react. 

Hinesburg's reagent is **benzene sulphonyl chloride**,
- It reacts with primary amine to form amide of sulphonic acid which is insoluble in water. 
- It reacts with sec. amine to form sec. amide of sulphonic acid. Which is soluble in water.
- It does not react with tert. amine. 

Adding KOH to the primary amide of sulphonic acid in first makes a salt which is soluble in water.

 | --------------------- | --------------------------- |
 | Sod. Bicarbonate test | Milky white with Lime water | 


For $\ce{ NaHCO_{3} }$ to react, the acid on the reactant side should be more acidic than carbonic acid. 

Thus, these can give the test,

- $\ce{ HX }$
- $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$
- $\ce{ HNO_{3} }$
- Phenol with Nitro group at para position, or with two or three nitro group.

These compounds do not react,
- Phenol
- Phenol with nitro at o- or m- positions
- Alcohol
- Terminal Alkyne

### Iodoform Test
$\ce{ CHX_{3} }$ is called **haloform.**
Iodoform is a yellow solid. 

Iodoform test is given by,
- $\ce{ CH_{3}-CO-H/R/Ar }$ (aldehyde or ketone with 3 $\alpha$ H)
- $\ce{ CH_{3}-CH(OH)-H/R/Ar }$ (alcohol which can get oxidised into the one above i.e. 1 and 2 deg alcohols)
- Hemiacetals as it can get oxidised to aldehyde and ketones which gives iodoform test.
