# Ozonolysis 
Of Alkenes and Alkynes

Dissociation of $\ce{ C=C/C#C }$ with $\ce{ O_{3} }$. (lysis means dissociation)

It is of 2 types,
1. **Reductive:** $\ce{ (i) O_{3}, (ii) H_{2}O + Zn/Me_{2}S  }$
   
2. **Oxidative:** $\ce{ (i) O_{3}, (ii) H_{2}O/H_{2}O_{2} }$

If nothing is said then do reductive. But it also depends on the question.  

The double bonds in aromatic rings don't do ozonolysis at room temp. It is only possible at high temp. 

#### Alkenes
Aldehydes and Ketones are formed. 

In reductive ozonolysis the third O of ozone gets reduced by Zn or $\ce{ Me_{2}S }$ and forms $\ce{ ZnO or Me_{2}S=O }$ respectively. $\ce{ Me_{2}S=O }$ is called *Dimethyl sulphoxide*, **DMSO** for short. 

In oxidative ozonolysis, the aldehyde gets oxidised to carboxylic acid. If both the products formed are ketones then the third O gets reduced by water and ketones remain untouched.

(in the last one, only adjacent diones get oxidised.)


#### Alkynes
Diones are formed. But only in reductive ozonolysis. 

In oxidative ozonolysis, carboxylic acids are formed.
