### Purification of Organic Compound 
Removal of impurities present in sample of compounds. 

The mp and bp of any pure compound is sharp. 

#### Sublimation
It is the phenomenon of conversion of solid directly to gas.

This method is used to separate sublimble compounds from non-sublimable.

This method is useful for ammonium chloride, naphthalene, camphor.

#### Crystallisation
Based on the difference in solubilities of the compound and impurity in suitable solvent. 

Benzoic acid is insoluble in cold water, but is soluble in hot water.

#### Distillation
##### Simple 
To separate volatile liquid from non-volatile liquid. having sufficient difference in their bp. 

For example, it can be used to separate, $\ce{ \underset{ 60^{\circ}C }{ CHCl_{3} } + \underset{ 189^{\circ}C }{ Ph-NH_{2} } }$

##### Fractional 
To separate two liquids when the difference in their boiling points is not much. 

The vapours of the liquid mixtures are passed through a fractionating column fitted over the mouth of round bottom flask.

The one which has the lowest bp is obtained first.

This method is used to separate components of crude oil,

##### Reduced Pressure
Used to purify liquids having very high bps and those which pdecompose at or before their bp.

As bp is the temp at which the vapour pressure is equal to the eternal pressure, when we decrease the external pressure, the bp al decreases. 

Other than reducing the pressure, everything else is the same as simple distillation.

##### Steam 
Used to separate compounds which are steam volatile and insoluble in water. Like aniline water mixture.

#### Differential Extraction
Based on the different solubility of an organic compound in different solvents. 

An organic solvent insoluble in water is added, then the flask is shook so that the component soluble in organic solvent is dissolved in it. Then the two layers are separated. 

This is done many times to completely remove one of the components.

#### Chromatography
It is based on the principle that different constituents are adsorbed on an adsorbent to different extents. 

**Stationary Phase:** adsorbent (silica gel, activated charcoal)
**Mobile Phase:** solvent (elute) + component 

##### Column
Glass column is taken with silica gel in it and the organic compound is added on top of it. As the compound starts to flow downwards, its components are separated, it is shown by distinct colours. The one which is farthest is the one which has the least degree of adsorption.

##### Thin Layer (TLC)
A beaker is taken with solvent and a thin plate coated with a thin layer of silica gel with a sample dot of the organic compound is dipped in it. The components of the dot are separated as the solvent climbs up the plate. 

![[thin-layer-chromatography.webp]]

We can also identify the components using their RF (Retarding Factor) values which are different for each compound. 

$$RF = \frac{ \text{distance travelled by component} }{ \text{distance travelled by solvent} }$$
this ratio is fixed.

RF Depends on,
1. Nature of adsorbent 
2. Mobile phase
3. Activity
4. Thickness of layer
5. Temperature
6. Equilibrium
7. Loading
8. Dipping zone
9. Chromatographic technique

##### Paper
Same as TLC but instead of using plate with silica gel, we use filter paper.
