# Amino Acids
**Proteins** are natural polymers of amino acids. 
Amino Acids are the monomers of Proteins. 

Proteins are decomposed to form polypeptide which are decomposed to form peptides which are then decomposed to form amino acids. 

In their names, they have "ine" as suffix.

Natural amino acids (vital): 20
Essential amino acids (not synthesised in body): 10
***PVT TIM HALL***

1. **P** = Phenyl alanine (Phe)
2. **V** = Valine (Val)
6. **T** = Threonine (Thr)
3. **T** = Tryptophan (Trp)
5. **I** = Isoleucine (I.le)
4. **M** = Methionine (Met)
7. **H** = Histidine (His)
8. **A** = Arginine (Arg)
9. **L** = Leucine (Leu)
10. **L** = Lysine (Lys)

Non-Essential amino acids (synthesised in body): 10
***CAAAGGG PST***

1. **C** = Cystein (Cys)
2. **A** = Alanine (Ala)
3. **A** = Aspartic acid (Asp)
4. **A** = Asparagine (Asn)
5. **G** = Glycine (Gly)
6. **G** = Glutamic acid (Glu)
7. **G** = Glutamine (Gin)
8. **P** = Proline (Pro)
9. **S** = Serine (Ser)
10. **T** = Tyrosine (Tyr)


## Structures
All these vital amino acids are $\alpha-$amino carboxylic acids (except proline).

Except Glycine, all natural amino acids are optically active with L-relative configuration ($\ce{ -NH_{2} }$ on the left side). 

Amino acid actually exists as a Zwitter ion. All natural amino acids are white crystalline solid with high mp and bp due to its polarity and with high density. They are soluble in polar solvent. 

They are polar molecules. Thus high MP, BP and soluble in polar solvent. 
All natural amino acids are white crystalline solids. 

15 amino acids are neutral. 2 are acidic and 3 are basic

6 contain aliphatic chain. 
2 contain hydroxy group. 
2 contain sulphur, Cystine and Methionine. 
3 contain aromatic ring, Phenyl alanine, Tyrosine, Tryptophan.

Aspartic acid is the most acidic with the COOH closes to $\ce{ NH_{2} }$  being more acidic (same with glutamic acid). 

Arginine is the most basic. 

### Zwitter Ionic structure 
also called Dipole Structure.  

When +ve and -ve charge exist on the same molecule *simultaneously* then that molecule is called a **Zwitter Ion.**

**Isoelectric Point:** At particular pH, no migration of $\alpha$-amino acids takes place under influence of electric field. It is indicated by pI. Amino acid exists as Zwitter ion at its pI. It is fixed for an amino acid.

At isoelectric point, the electricity passing through the circuit will me minimum. 

The pH of zwitter ionic structure is the isoelectric point. It is the average of the $\ce{ pk_{a} }$ either side of the ion. 

Cationic structure exists at low pH. 

Neural structure is Zwitter ionic structure. 

Anionic structure exists at high pH. 

#### Isoelectric points 
Isoelectric point for neutral amino acids is,
$$\ce{ pI = \frac{ pk_{a_{1}} + pk_{a_{2}} }{ 2 } }$$
it ranges from 5.2 to 6.2.

Isoelectric point for acidic amino acids is,
$$\ce{ pI = \frac{ pk_{a_{1}} + pk_{a_{2}} }{ 2 } }$$
it ranges from 3 to 4.

Isoelectric point for basic amino acids is,
$$\ce{ pI = \frac{ pk_{a_{2}} + pk_{a_{3}} }{ 2 } }$$
it ranges from 10 to 11.

## Chemical Reactions of Amino Acids
They show reactions of carboxylic acids and amines.
[[04 Carboxylic Acid]]
[[05 Reactions of Amines]]

#### Reactions of $\ce{-COOH}$ group

#### Reactions of $\ce{ -NH_{2} }$ group

Reaction with $\ce{ CH_{2}=O }$ is used to block the $\ce{ -NH_{2} }$ groups. Then titration with base will give an estimation of -COOH groups. This is called **Sorenson's Method.** 

Reaction with **Sanger's Reagent** gives estimation of free $\ce{ -NH_{2} }$ groups in peptides. 

![[Pasted image 20240107184613.png]]

Reaction with $\ce{ HNO_{3} }$ forms $\alpha$ hydroxy carboxylic acid with retention in configuration of chiral carbon. 

This is because the reaction occurs through $\ce{ S_{N}(NGP) }$ (neighbouring group participation) mechanism. 

![[Pasted image 20240107185227.png]]

Van-Slyk's method is used to estimate no. of $\ce{ -NH_{2} }$ groups by estimating the volume of $\ce{ N_{2} }$ formed. 
It will not work in Proline as it has no $\ce{ -NH_{2} }$ group.

##### $\ce{ S_{N}(NGP) }$ Mechanism 
It consist of twice inversion and thus retention of configuration.

Forms complex which is blue in colur.
