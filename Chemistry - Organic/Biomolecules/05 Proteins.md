# Proteins
They are polymers of [[04 Amino Acids]] where the monomers are linked through peptide bond with each other. 

DNA is responsible for synthesis of proteins.

#### Denaturation and Renaturation of Protein
The protein found in a biological system with specific configuration and biological activity is known as native protein. 

The loss of biological activity of a native protein due to physical and chemical treatment is called Denaturation. 

The process of conversion of globular protein into fibrous protein is a kind of denaturation. 
E.g. boiling of egg, conversion of milk into paneer. 

Denaturation brings about change in the secondary and tertiary structure of protein. The primary structure remains intact.

The reverse process of denaturation is called renaturation.

### Structure of Protein
##### Primary Structure
The sequence of amino acid in each polypeptide chain/protein molecule.

#### Secondary
The local folded structure that forms within a polypeptide due to interaction between atoms of the amino acids. 

Secondary structure is formed by H-bonds. 

1. **$\alpha$-helix:** when alkyl group is small. 
   - H bonding is between 1st and 4th amino acid. 
   - H bonding forms 13 membered cyclic structure. 
   - One cycle is approx. 3.6 amino acids.
   - It is found is $\alpha$ keratin and myosin.
1. **$\beta$-pleated sheet:** when alkyl group is large.
   - parallel $\beta$ pleated and anti-parallel $\beta$ pleated structures.
   - It is found in fibroin (skin protein)

#### Tertiary
The overall folding of the polypeptide chain in 3D.

They are stabilised by H-bonds, Van Der Waal's forces, Disulphide bondage and ionic or salt bridges.

#### Quaternary 
Many proteins are composed of more than one polypeptide chains, referred to as sub units. These are held together by some weak forces. 

The spatial arrangement of these with respect to each other is called the quaternary structure.

### Classification of Proteins

#### On the basis of Molecular Structures
##### Fibrous 
When polypeptide chain run parallel and form a fibre like structure.

These proteins chains are held together by H bonding and disulphide linkage. 

They are water insoluble. 

Examples are Keratin and Myosin.

##### Globular
When the polypeptide chain is folded to form spheroidal structure. 

The inner part has lipophilic groups and outer part has hydrophilic groups. 

They are soluble in water.

Examples are Albumin in egg and enzymes. 

#### On the basis of Chemical Composition 
##### Simple 
They give only amino acids on hydrolysis. I.e. they are formed by only amino acids.

Examples are Albumin, Globulin (in tissues), Glutalin (in wheat, rice). 

##### Conjugate 
In which protein part is combined with non proteins part. 
They give a non protein part along with amino acid on hydrolysis.

The non protein part is called prosthetic part. They can control biological functions. It may be carbohydrate, phosphate, lipid etc.

##### Derived 
When proteins are hydrolysed by acid/base/enzyme then the obtained (degraded) proteins are called derived.
