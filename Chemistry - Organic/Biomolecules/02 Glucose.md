# Glucose (D-Glucose)
General name: Dextrose. It is actually Aldohexose.

D-Glucose because the last chiral carbon in the carbohydrate chain has its OH on the right hand side and the molecule is dextrorotatory. L-Glucose is the mirror image of the D one (it is enantiomer of D-Glucose) 

If we change the configuration of any one of the OH then the name changes. 

In open chain there are 4 chiral carbons. 

The D in D-Glucose is because the configuration of the last chiral C is the same as d-Glyceraldehyde. 

Glucose is actually cyclic. But whenever a strong reagent comes the cycle breaks. Thus most of the reactions and properties of glucose are based on the open chain structure.

The H of the OH on the 5th C makes bond with the O on the first C and the O of the OH on the 5th C makes bond with the first C. 

## Preparation
#### From Starch
$$\ce{ (C_{6}H_{12}O_{6})_{n} + H_{2}O ->[H+] nC_{6}H_{12}O_{6} }$$

#### From Sucrose
$$\ce{ C_{12}H_{22}O_{11} + H_{2}O ->[H+] \underset{ glucose }{ C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} } + \underset{ fructose }{ C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} } }$$

## Chemical Reactions
[[00 Carbonyl Compounds#Chemical Reactions]]

Reactions of D-Glucose are just reactions of Aldehydes and Alcohols.

##### Open chain and presence of Aldehyde Group
Reaction with HI + Red P indicates presence of 6 membered straight chain.

The formation of cyanohydrins and oximes of glucose show the presence of aldehyde or ketone group.

(sarbitol)

##### Reductive Sugar

Reaction with bromine water, Tollen's reagent, Fehling's solution and Benedict solution shows presence of -CHO group.

(gluconic acid has only one acid)

##### Evidence of Cyclic Structure 
Zyamase enzyme (which is present in yeast) decomposes glucose to ethyl alcohol. It is used in brewery to form alcohol from glucose.

Aldehyde and Ketones make yellow orange ppt with 2,4-DNP. 
[[00 Carbonyl Compounds#Reaction with N containing Nucleophile]]

They also react with $\ce{ NaHSO_{3} }$ to give white ppt. 
[[05 Detection of FG#Carbonyl Compounds]]

And with Schiff's Reagent to give pink ppt. 

Glucose does not react with any of the 3. This is due to the cyclic structure of glucose. These three are weak reagents and cannot break the cyclic structure.

(Glucaric acid has 2 acids, Saccharic acid)

##### Presence of 5 OH groups
[[02 Oxidation#With Periodic Acid]]
[[03 Phenol#Formation of Ethers]]
[[04 Nucleophilic Substitution Th]]

Reaction with dimethyl sulphate and acetic anhydride shows presence of 5 OH groups.

(pentamethyl-o-glucose, pentaacetyl-o-glucose/glucose pentaacetate, methyl-$\alpha$-glucoside, methyl-$\beta$-glucoside)

##### Reaction with Phenyl Hydrazine 
Reaction with phenyl hydrazine forms Glucosazone which is an Osazone. A molecule of aniline is formed. 

![[Pasted image 20240106194420.png]]

Osazone is a solid compound. It is the characteristic compound of carbohydrates. Identifying its mp gives idea of the carbohydrate. 

Further reaction of osazone is not possible with phenyl hydrazine because osazone is stabilised by intramolecular hydrogen bonding. 

![[Pasted image 20240106195246.png]]

D-Glucose, D-Fructose and D-Mannose form identical osazone with phenyl hydrazine because configuration of chiral carbons of R group (remaining part) are same. (3,4,5 C have the same config)

![[Pasted image 20240106195257.png]]
(the last C in Mannose has an OH group)

Fructose is just glucose but 1 and 2 C are exchanged.
Mannose is just glucose but the 2nd OH is on left hand side.
