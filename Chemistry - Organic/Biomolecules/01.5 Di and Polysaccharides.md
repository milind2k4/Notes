**Two types:**
1.  *Non-Reducing:* e.g. sucrose (cane sugar)
1.  *Reducing:* e.g. maltose (malt sugar), lactose (milk sugar), cellubiose

All have the same molecular formula, $\ce{ C_{12}H_{22}O_{11} }$ which is,
$$\ce{ (C_{6}H_{11}O_{5})-O-(C_{6}H_{11}O_{5}) }$$

### Hydrolysis of disaccharides
Sucrose converts to D-Glucose + D-Fructose in acidic medium or with invertase (aka sucrase).
Hydrolysis of Sucrose is called Inversion of sugar. 

This is because the specific rotation of sucrose is +66.5 and that of the mix formed is -20. 

Maltose converts to 2 D-Glucose in acidic medium or with Maltase. 

Cellubiose also converts to 2 D-Glucose. 

Lactose converts to D-Glucose + D-Galactose in acidic medium or with Lactase.

### Structure of Sucrose
Made of D-$\alpha$-Glucopyranose and D-$\beta$-fructofurinose

It is a dimer. 

Since none of the two chains have hemiacetal groups, it is not a reducing sugar. 

It has $\ce{ C_{1}-C_{2} }$ glycosidic linkage.

### Structure of Maltose
Dimer of D-Glucose. Since Glucose is of two types, Maltose is also, $\alpha$-Maltose and $\beta$-Maltose.

One of the glucose is $\alpha$, and the other can be either $\alpha$ or $\beta$.

It has $\ce{ \alpha-C_{1}-C_{4} }$ glycosidic linkage. $\alpha$ because the anomeric C of the non-reducing half is in $\alpha$ configuration.

It is made of one reducing half and one non-reducing half thus on the whose it is a reducing sugar.  

Since it has hemiacetal group, it can show mutaroation and is a reducing sugar. 

The non reducing half is $\alpha$-D-Glucose.

### Structure of Cellubiose 
Same as Maltose, but the linkage is $\ce{ \beta-C_{1}-C_{4} }$ Glycosidic linkage.

One of the glucose is $\beta$ (non-reducing half), and the other can be either $\alpha$ or $\beta$ (reducing half).

### Structure of Lactose 
Dimer of one D-Glucopyranose unit (reducing) + one D-$\beta$-Galactopyranose unit (non-reducing half). 

Galactose is glucose but the 4th C is different.

## Polysaccharides
Natural polymers of monosaccharides.

All are non-reducing. 

### Starch
Natural polymer of Glucose. 
Monomer unit is D-$\alpha$-Glucose. 
Dimer unit is $\alpha$-Maltose. 

There is $\ce{ \alpha-C_{1}-C_{4} }$ glycosidic linkage like in maltose.

Starch is used as food storage in plant cell.

**There are 2 parts of starch:**

| Amylose                                              | Amylopectin                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 20% part of starch                                   | 80% part                                                                                                  |
| Soluble in hot water                                 | Insoluble in water                                                                                        |
| Lesser degree of polymerisation (less no of glucose) | Higher degree of polymerisation (more no of glucose)                                                      |
| Less molecular weight                                | More molecular weight                                                                                     |
| Blue complex with $\ce{ I_{2}T }$                    | Violet complex with $\ce{ I_{2} }$                                                                        |
| Unbranched polymer                                   | Branched Polymer. Branching is between $\ce{ C_{1}-C_{6} }$ There is a new branch every 25th to 30th unit |

### Glycogen
Structure is the same as amylopectin but it is more branched than it and has a branch at every 5th or 6th glucose unit. 

It is used as food storage in animal cells. 

### Cellulose
Natural polymer of $\beta$-Glucose.
Monomer unit: $\beta$-D-Glucopyranose 
Dimer unit is $\beta$ Cellubiose unit.

Higher degree of polymerisation than starch. Cotton is almost purely cellulose.

Glycosidic Linkage: $\ce{ \beta-C_{1}-C_{4 }}$

It is the material of cell wall. 

Its structure is unbranched.

It is indigestible in humans because our digestive system does not contain any enzyme which can convert cellulose to glucose.
