# Carbohydrates 
Carbohydrate = hydrate of carbon i.e. $\ce{ C_{n}(H_{2}O)_{n} }$

However there are many molecules which follow this but are not carbohydrates. Like Formaldehyde or Acetic acid. 
And there are many compounds which do not follow this formula but are carbohydrates.

**Carbohydrates are,**
Poly-hydroxy aldehydes/ketones 
$$or$$
Cyclic hemiacetal/hemiketal/acetal/keyal of poly-hydroxy aldehyde ketones.
$$or$$
Compounds which can be hydrolysed to poly-hydroxy carbonyl compounds. 

#### Monosaccharides
Simple carbohydrates which can not be hydrolysed.
E.g. glucose, fructose, ribose, galactose, mannose etc. 

General formula: $\ce{ C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} }$

#### Disaccharides
Carbohydrates which give 2 molecules of monosaccharides on hydrolysis. 
(similarly tri, tetra)
E.g. sucrose, maltose, lactose etc.

#### Oligosaccharides 
Carbohydrates which give 2 to 10 molecules of monosaccharides on hydrolysis. 
E.g. sucrose, maltose

#### Polysaccharides
Carbohydrates which give many molecules (more than 10) of monosaccharides on hydrolysis. 
E.g. starch, cellulose, glycogen

General Formula: $\ce{ (C_{6}H_{12}O_{6})_{n} }$ ($n$ = 300 - 1000)

### General Nomenclature of Carbohydrates
**General suffix:** "-ose"

**On the basis of number of carbon atoms:** triose, tetrose, pentose, hexose etc.

Aldehyde group containing carbohydrates are called **Aldose**
Ketonic group containing carbohydrates are called **Ketose**

Smallest Aldose and Ketose,

![[Pasted image 20240106190124.png]]

We combine the last three,
Aldose with 3 C is called Aldotriose.
Ketose with 4 C is called Ketotetraose.
and so on. 

A 6 membered ring carbohydrate is called **Pyranose.**
5 membered ones are called **Furanose**

Monosaccharides of up to 7 C are found in nature. 

### Classification of Carbohydrates:
1. **Sugars:** crystalline, sweet, soluble in water
2. **Non-Sugars:** non-crystalline, unsweet, insoluble in water
	   - All polysaccharides: Starch, Cellulose, Glycogen

**Sugars are further classified,**
1. *Monosaccharides* 
	   - Aldo-Triose: Glyceraldehyde
	   - Aldo-Tetrose: Erythrose, Threose
	   - Aldo-Pentose: Ribose, Arabinose
	   - Hexose:
		 - Aldohexose: Glucose, Mannose
		 - Ketohexose: Fructose 
2. *Oligosaccharides:*
	   - Disaccharides: Sucrose, Maltose, Lactose 
	   - Trisaccharides
	   - 
	   - 
	   - Decasaccharides

**On the basis of reducing properties,**
1. *Reducing Sugars:* which reduce Tollen's reagent and Fehling's solution. E.g. glucose, fructose 
1.  *Non-Reducing Sugars:* which do not reduce Tollen's reagent and Fehling's solution.

Difference between reducing and non reducing sugars:

| Reducing                                                         | Non-Reducing                                                              |     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Free hemiacetal group present                                    | Free hemiacetal group absent                                              |     |
| Reacts with Tollen's reagent fehling solution, benedict solution | Does not reacts with Tollen's reagent fehling solution, benedict solution |     |
| Forms osazone with $\ce{ Ph-NH-NH_{2} }$                                | Does not form osazone with $\ce{ Ph-NH-NH_{2} }$                                 |     |
| Shows mutarotation                                               | Does not show mutarotation                                                |     |

## [[02 Glucose]]

## Fructose (D-Fructose)
Aka **Fruit Sugar** and **Laevolose.** It is a ketohexose.

It exists as a 5 membered ring and thus it is called **Furanose.**

The one which has OH on the inside is $\alpha$ and the one which has it on the outside is $\beta$. 

It also does not show reaction with 2,4-DNP. 

It can show mutarotation. After mutatrotation, the mix has specific rotation of -92$^{\circ}$.

The anomeric C in fructose is the 2nd one.

### Chemical Reactions
Are like [[02 Glucose#Chemical Reactions]]

Any reaction that makes the 2nd C chiral forms two products which are diastereomers.

(sorbitol, mannitol)

Bromine water does not react as there is no aldehyde. 
With nitric acid two diacid is formed. 

Fructose gives +ve test with Tollen's Reagent, Fehling solution and Benedict solution as it is a $\alpha$ Hydroxy ketone. Thus it is a reducing sugar. 

![[Pasted image 20240106211742.png]]

With periodic acid, methanol, dimethyl sulphate and acetic anhydride, the reactions are the same as that with glucose.

![[Pasted image 20240106211807.png]]

Fructose does not react with 2,4-DNP due to its cyclc structure and does not react with Schiff's reagent and $\ce{ NaHSO_{3} }$ because it is a ketone.
