##### Some Definitions 
**Anomers:** Diastereomers in carbohydrates which have different configuration of only one chiral C (it can be hemiacetalic, hemiketalic or acetalic or ketalic C)

**Epimers:** Such type of diastereomers which have different configuration only on one chiral carbon which is not the anomeric carbon. D-Glucose, D-Mannose, D-Allose and D-Galactose

**Mutarotation:** Spontaneous change in specific rotation of an optically active compound up to an equilibrium state. I.e. automatic change in specific rotation with time.

**Diastereomers:** It is when two or more stereoisomers of a compound have different configurations at one or more of the equivalent stereocenters and are not mirror images of each other

#### Glycosidic Linkage 
Linkage through oxygen atom by which 2 monosaccharides are linked in oligo or polysaccharides. 

[[01.5 Di and Polysaccharides]]

#### Inversion of Sugar
Sucrose is dextrorotatory. On hydrolysis it gives a mixture of dextrorotatory glucose (+52.5$^{\circ}$) and laevorotatory fructose (-92.4$^{\circ}$). The net optical rotation of the mixture is -ve. This change of sign of rotation from dextrorotatory laevorotatory is called inversion of sugar. 


### Peptide
#### Peptide Bond
When two amino acid are joined by removal of OH from COOH and H from $\ce{ NH_{2} }$, the bond formed is called Peptide bond. 

It is basically a secondary amide bond.

##### Dipeptide
Where 2 amino acids are joined by one peptide bond. 
Dipeptides have one Peptide Bond.

Name is Alanyl glycine (Ala-Gly)

##### Tripeptide
When 3 amino acids are joined by 2 peptide bonds.
