# Nucleic Acid
Polymers of nucleotide. 

**Nucleotides** are molecules containing nitrogen containing base, phosphate and a sugar. 

The sugar present could be **2-deoxy-D-ribose** or **D-ribose**. 
The base could be:
1. **Purine Base:** Adenine (A) or Guanine (G)
2. **Pyrimidine Base:** Cytosine (C), Thymine (T) or Uracil (U)

**Nucleoside:** a structural subunit of nucleic acids
The heredity-controlling components of all living cells, consisting of a molecule of sugar linked to a nitrogen-containing organic ring compound.

**Phosphodiester Linkage:** linkage between two nucleotides at $\ce{ C_{5} }$ and $\ce{ C_{2} }$. 

Nucleic Acid is of two types:

| DNA                                                | RNA                             |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Deoxy ribonucleic Acid                             | Ribonucleic Acid                |
| Sugar present is 2-deoxy-D-ribose                  | Sugar present is D-ribose       |
| Bases present are A,G,C & T                        | Bases present are A,G,C & U     |
| Present in Nucleus of cells                        | Present in Cytoplasm of cells   |
| Double stranded helix structure                    | Single stranded helix structure |
| Transmits hereditary material                      | Helps in synthesis of proteins  | 
| Replicates (produces 2 identical copies of itself) | Does not replicate              |

There are 3 types of RNA:
1. $\ce{ _{t}RNA: }$ Transfer
1. $\ce{ _{r}RNA: }$ Ribosomal
1. $\ce{ _{m}RNA: }$ Messenger (copies base sequence of DNA)

### Structure of DNA
There is H-bonding between $\ce{ C <-> G \& A <-> T }$

The two strands of DNA are not identical but complimentary because there is H-bonding between specific pairs of bases.

To convert from DNA to RNA,
$\ce{ C <-> G }$
$\ce{ T -> A }$
$\ce{ A -> U }$

Thus if DNA is **ATTGC** it's corresponding RNA will be **UAACG**.

### DNA Fingerprinting
The sequence of bases in DNA is unique. The information regarding this is called DNA fingerprinting. 

It is used for:
1. Identifying Criminals
2. Paternity Test
3. Racial Evolution
