# Cyclic Structure
Glucose exists as 6 membered cyclic hemiacetalic structure. 

A 6 membered ring carbohydrate is called **Pyranose.**
5 membered ones are called **Furanose.**

A compound which has OH and OR groups connected to one C atom is called hemiacetal or hemiketal.

##### Evidence of Cyclic Structure
1. No reaction with 2,4-DNP, Shiff's reagent and $\ce{ NaHSO_{3} }$.
2. It forms 2 glucosides with methyl alcohol. 
3. It exists as 2 anomeric forms. 
	- $\alpha$-D-Glucose with mp 146 $^{\circ}$C, $[\alpha] = +112^{\circ}$ 
	- $\beta$-D-Glucose with mp 148-150$^{\circ}$C, $[\alpha] = +19^{\circ}$
1. It shows Mutarotation. 
	- If any of $\alpha$ or $\beta$-D-Glucose is left in water, their specific rotation changes and stops at +52$^{\circ}$.

#### Structure of Glucose
The H of the OH of 5th C goes to the O of aldehyde as it are acidic. This forms an OH at the aldehyde and a bond with the O which donated the H.

Now, after cyclization, the C of aldehyde which was not chiral, becomes chiral. Thus two configurations are formed.

If the OH is inside then it is $\alpha$, if it is outside, then it is $\beta$.

Hawarth structure is when the molecule is represented as hexagon. The OH which is on LHS (outside) is put on top. And the 6th C is also put on top.

In Hawarth structure of $\beta$-D-Glucose, all the first OH is on the top side, and the rest are put alternatingly.

Since in $\beta$, the big groups are at equatorial positions, it is more stable then $\alpha$. 

##### Explanation of Evidence 
**Non Reaction with some Reagents:** Cyclic structures of glucose are not much stable as they can be opened by strong reagent like Tollen's reagent, phenyl hydrazine, Fehling solution etc, but cannot be opened by weak reagents like 2,4-DNP, $\ce{ NaHSO_{3} }$ and Schiff's reagent. 

**Anomers:** $\alpha$ and $\beta$-D-Glucose are anomers of each other. The anomeric C is the 1st one.

**Mutarotation:** When water is added to either $\alpha$ or $\beta$, the chain opens, then reforms, which makes a specific composition mixture. This mix has a specific rotation of around $52^{\circ}$.

**Formation of 2 Glucosides:** Since there are OH and OR on the same C, the structure is hemiacetal.

Non Reducing because there is an Me/Ac group at the place of H and Tollen's reagent cannot send it, unlike H, to the O in the chain to open the chain and form aldehyde and react with it.

If there is OH and OR on the same C (i.e. hemiacetal), then it is reducing sugar.
