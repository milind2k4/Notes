# Enzymes
Enzymes are bio molecules which catalyse bio-chemical reactions. This is why enzymes are called bio-catalysts. 

**Phenyl Ketone Urea** is a disease caused due to deficiency of enzymes. 

Properties of Enzymes:
1. **Specific in Nature:** One enzyme catalyses only one reaction
2. Only required in small quantities.
3. Highly efficient (increases rate to $10^{22}$ times)
1. Only works under optimal temperature ($\ce{ 37^{\circ}C }$) and pH ($\ce{ 7 }$)

**Prosthetic Group:** non-protein part of enzyme 
**Co-factor:** Prosthetic Group attached with enzyme by covalent bond
**Co-enzyme:** Prosthetic Group attached with the enzyme during enzyme action.


### Mechanism of Enzyme Action
1. $$\ce{ \underset{ substrate }{ S } + \underset{ \text{enzyme} }{ E } -> \underset{ \text{enzyme-substrate complex} }{ [ES] } }$$
2. $$\ce{ [ES] -> \underset{ \text{enzyme-product complex} }{ [EP] } }$$
3. $$\ce{ [EP] -> \underset{ product }{ P } + E }$$

This is also called **Lock and Key** theory.
