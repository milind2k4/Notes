[[02 Benzene Diazonium Salt#Reduction]]

Nitro, Cyanide, Isocyanide, Amide, Imine, Isocyanate, Azide, Diazonium salt, Oxime

In aromatic, $\ce{ LiAlH_{4} }$ converts it to Azo benzene.

#### By Hydrolysis of Amide / Isocyanide / Isocyanate / Imine
only sec. and tert. amide give amine.

#### By Grignard Reagent 
Reaction of Grignard reagent with Chloramine forms pri. amine or aniline.

Similar to this, Ether is also formed.

#### By Ammonolysis of Alkyl/Aryl Halide 
[[02 SN Reactions of Alkyl Halides#Ammonolysis of Alkyl halides]]

In aromatic, $\ce{ NaNH_{2} + NH_{3}, \Delta }$ by Benzene mechanism forms aniline. 
Or, we can use $\ce{ Cu_{2}O }$ as catalyst. 
$\ce{ NH_{3} + Cu_{2}O, \Delta }$ gives aniline and $\ce{ R-NH_{2} + Cu_{2}O, \Delta }$ gives sec. aniline.

#### Gabriel Phthalimide Reaction
#named_reaction 

This reaction only forms pri. aliphatic amine.

Formation of Phthalimide,
![[Pasted image 20240101194331.png]]

Phthalimide is reacted with base to form salt. This salt is ambidentate as both O and N have -ve charge. But on reaction N reacts as it has more nucleophilicity compared to O. 

The salt does [[01 SN1 and SN2 Mechanisms#$ ce{ S_{N}2 }$ Reaction|SN2]] reaction with pri. or sec. alkyl halide to form N alkyl phthalimide. This is then hydrolysed to form pri. amine and phthalic acid. 

With hydrazine also, pri. amine is formed. 

The salt does not react with aryl halide because aromatic ring does not give SN reactions. 

If we take $\alpha-$halo ester, then SN2 reaction happens and then on hydrolysis phthalic acid, methyl alcohol and amino acid are formed.

All the following are intramolecular. 
#### Hofmann's Bromamide Rearrangement 
aka **Hofmann's Hypobromite reaction, Hofmann's Bromamide Degradation**

Adding bromine + KOH (or KOBr) to primary amine forms primary amine, reducing one C. 

#mechanism consists of 3 intermediates.

Here the leaving group is Br$^{-}$. 
Here $\ce{ CO_{2} }$ is formed which then reacts in basic medium to form carbonate. 

Reactivity of this reaction is directly proportional to the migratory aptitude of migrating group.

#### Curtius Reaction 
Here, azide is reacted to form Isocyanate is formed. 

#mechanism 
![[Pasted image 20240102125727.png]]

Isocyanate can then the be hydrolysed to form Amines. 

#### Schmidt Reaction 
In this reaction, carboxylic acid is reacted to form amine. 

Carboxylic acid is reacted with Hydrazoic acid in presence of $\ce{ conc. H_{2}SO_{4} }$ to form amine and $\ce{ CO_{2} + N_{2} }$.

#mechanism 
First azide it formed and then by curtius reaction, isocyanate is formed which is then hydrolysed. 

![[Pasted image 20240102130159.png]]

This reaction also happens in Ketones to form sec. amide.

#### Lossen Rearrangement 
In this reaction, hydroxymic acid is reacted with conc. $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$ to form isocyanate. 

#mechanism 
![[Pasted image 20240102130807.png]]

If isocyanate is  reacted with alcohol instead of hydrolysis, **Urethane** is formed. 
With ammonia, a urea derivative is formed. 

![[Pasted image 20240102131255.png]]

#### Beckmann's Rearrangement 
It happens in Ketoximes. 

On addition of a dehydrating agent, sec. amide is formed. 

The R group trans to the OH connected to the N is the one which migrates.
