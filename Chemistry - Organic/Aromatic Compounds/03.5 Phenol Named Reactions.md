#### Claisen Condensation
It is rearrangement of aryl allyl ether or allyl vinyl ether. It is a pericyclic reaction. 

Allyl Phenyl ether gives intramolecular rearrangement reaction on high temp (~200 $^{\circ}$C) and forms o-allyl phenol. 

#mechanism consists of formation of 6 MCTS.

If both o positions have substituents, then allyl group is attached to p position.

In Allyl Vinyl Ether, $\upgamma-\delta$-unsaturated ketone/aldehyde is formed.

If mixture of reactants is taken, 
![[Pasted image 20231229205327.png]]
Since there are only 2 products formed, it indicates that it is an intramolecular rearrangement.

#### Fries Rearrangement 
It is rearrangement of ester. 

Phenyl esters give Fries rearrangement in presence of $\ce{ AlCl_{3} }$. 
This rearrangement is intramolecular as well as intermolecular. #important 
This is the only rearrangement which is intermolecular. 

It is kind of a [[03 Fridal Craft Reactions and More]].

This reaction has TCP and KCP but they are reverse of [[01 Nitration and Sulphonation#Sulphonation]]

o as well as p isomers are formed.

Since the rearrangement forms cation which is separated from the reactant, intermolecular rearrangements is also shown. 

Thus if mixture is taken, 4 products are formed. This is evidence of intermolecular as well as intramolecular reaction.

#### Lederer Manasse Reaction
Reaction with formaldehyde. 
![[Pasted image 20231229212456.png]]

Products of this reaction can form polymers. 

**Novalac/Resol** (linear polymer) and **Bakelite** (3d polymer),

### Kolbe - Schmitt Reaction 
Salicylic acid is formed which is a very #important compound. 

#mechanism 
![[Pasted image 20231229213338.png]]

In presence of NaOH,
- 125 C forms o major. (KCP)
- 300 C forms p major. (TCP)

Generally o product is major due to intramolecular H bonding. But in presence of KOH, p isomer is major due to steric hinderance. 

Acetylation of Salicylic acid gives **Acetyl Salicylic Acid aka Aspirin.** Aspirin is analgesic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory and blood thinner.

Esterification with methyl alcohol forms Methyl Salicylate which is used as perfume and mouth wash.

Esterification with phenol forms Phenyl Salicylate aka **Salol.** Salol is antiseptic and antipyretic.

### Reimer Teimann Reaction 
##### RT Formylation 
Phenol is reacted with choloroform in presence of NaOH which forms Salicaldehyde and its p isomer. 

#mechanism [[00 Elimination Reactions#1,1-Elimination]] + [[00 Electrophilic Substitution]]

##### RT Carboxylation 
Phenol is reacted with carbon tetrachloride in presence of NaOH and forms Salicylic Acid and its p isomer. 

#mechanism 

![[Pasted image 20231229215652.png]]

##### Examples 
On o-cresol, due to steric hinderance, the p product is major.
