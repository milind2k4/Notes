# Phenol 
Phenol is also known as **Carbolic Acid** even though it is not very acidic. It does give litmus test. 

If there is Me at o,m,p positions, it is called Cresol.   

Two OH groups next to each other is Catechol. 
Two OH groups not next to each other is Resorcinol. 
Two OH groups opposite to each other is Hydro-quinone/p-quinol. 

Three OH next to each other is called Pyrogallol.
Three OH alternate to each other is called Phloroglucinol.
Three OH two next to each other is called Hydroxy Hydro-quinone.

$\ce{ Me_{2}SO_{4} }$ (dimethyl sulphate) is methylating agent for R-OH, Ar-OH, -NH$_{2}$, -SH groups. 
It can also be used to find how many -OH groups a compound has. We find it by measuring molecular weight before and after. 

Diazomethane can give reaction with acidic hydrogen ($\ce{ -COOH, -SO_{3}H, -OH }$).

#### Reaction with $\ce{ PCl_{5} }$
[[04 Nucleophilic Substitution Th#Other Reactions of $ ce{ PCl_{5} }$]]

Here however, in addition to cholorobenzene, Triphenyl Phosphate is formed in major amount.
Nucleophilic substitution takes place on $\ce{ POCl_{3} }$.

#### Reaction with Phthalic Anhydride 
aka **Phthalein Dye Test**

When two molecules of phenol are reacted with phthalic anhydride, phenolphthalein indicator is formed. 

It is electrophilic addition reaction. 

![[Pasted image 20240101183556.png]]

o-cresol becomes red and m-cresol becomes blue on reaction with phthalic anhydride. p-cresol does not react.

Formation of DDT (p-p'-dicholoro-diphenyl-tricholoroethane) , which is used as pesticide,

![[Pasted image 20240101184555.png]]

#### Oxidation 
Since the aromatic ring in phenol has more e density, it can be oxidised. 

With Chromyl Chloride or other methods, **Benzoquinone / quinone** is formed. It is of pink colour.

With $\ce{ K_{2}S_{2}O_{8} }$ it converts to hydroxy quinone and catechol. This is called **Elb's Reaction.** #named_reaction

### Test of Phenols 
[[05 Detection of FG#Alcohols]]

**Litmus Test:** Phenols turn blue litmus red. 
**Sodium Metal Test:** Liberate hydrogen gas. 
*Sodium Bicarbonate Test:* No reaction.
**Phthalein Dye Test:** Solution is colourless
**Bromine Water Test:** White ppt is formed.
**Neutral $\ce{ FeCl_{3} }$ Test:** Violet Complex is formed.

##### Libermann's Nitroso Test of Phenol 
aka **GRB test**

p-nitroso phenol is formed. Which then tautomerizes. This tautomer then reacts with another molecule of phenol to form protonated Indophenol which is **Green.** 

On dilution, Indophenol is formed which is **Red.**
On adding base, salt of Indophenol is formed which is of **Blue.**
