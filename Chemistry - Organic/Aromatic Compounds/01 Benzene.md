# Benzene
#### Formation 
##### By Phenol 
![[Pasted image 20231228202032.png]]

##### By Grignard Reagent 
If Grignard reagent is reacted with [[02 Acid Base Reactions and GR#Acid base Reaction of Active H|active H]], it forms benzene.

##### By Aromatisation of n-Hexane
If n Hexane is heated in presence of alumina, dehydrogenation occurs and aromatic ring is formed. 

If n heptane is taken instead, toluene is formed.
If n octane is taken instead, ethyl benzene and xylene is formed.

##### By Acetylene 
The reaction is pericyclic. The transition state is cyclic.

If propyne is used, Mesitylene is formed which is also called *symmetrical trimethyl benzene.* It is the most stable isomer of trimethyl benzene.
