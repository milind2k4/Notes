# Benzene Diazonium Salt
### Formation by Diazotisation 
#named_reaction 

We take a primary aromatic amine and react it with $\ce{ KNO_{2} + HCl }$ or Nitrous Acid, $\ce{ HNO_{2} }$, at 0-5 $^{\circ}$C. 

Diazonium salt is stable up to 5$^{\circ}$C. Because in $\ce{ Ar-^{+}N#N }$ the $\ce{ ^{+}N#N }$ is a very good leaving group. 
And with aliphatic, diazonium salt is unstable.

### Chemical Reactions 
[[04 ArSN Reactions]]
It mainly gives $\ce{ ArS_{N}1 }$ reactions. 

Only N can form cation at double bond. Since this cation is very unstable, it reacts with any nucleophile.

#### Reduction 
With Sn + HCl, it forms hydrogen chloride of phenyl hydrazine. 

With Zn + HCl, aniline is formed.

#### Coupling Reaction 
#important 

If a strong +M group is on benzene ring, then its on reaction with diazonium salt, at 0-5 $^{\circ}$C at a specific pH, the para H is replaced by diazonium, forming a dye. 

Only p-isomer is formed due to steric hindrance. Which can be syn as well as anti in terms of lp on both N. If there is no H is present at p, then o-product is formed. 

The compound formed is *Azo Dye.* It is coloured due to extendend conjugation.

Reactivity is increased if an EDG is connected to reactant and an EWG with the diazonium salt. 

With phenol pH is 8-9 and it forms Orange Dye. 
With aniline pH is 5-6 and it forms Red-Brown Dye. 

If medium is too basic, the OH from the solvent will react with diazonium salt to form phenol. 
If medium is too acidic, the OH from the solvent will react with aniline to form ammonium salt.

With $\alpha$-naphthol it forms Red Dye. 
With $\beta$-naphthol it forms Orange Dye. 

Diazonium salt also reacts with pyrol. But not with Furan or thiophene
