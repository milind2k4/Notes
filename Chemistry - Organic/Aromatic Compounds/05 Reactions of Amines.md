# Chemical Reactions given by Amines
### Reactions given by Aliphatic as well as Aromatic Amines 

#### Acid Base Reactions 
Since amines are of basic nature, they give [[02 Acid Base Reactions and GR]]. 

##### Reaction with Strong Acid
With chloro platinic acid or chloro auric acid it forms ppt. And thus these reactions are used to separate amines from non amine compounds.

#### Acylation 
[[03 Phenol#o-Acylation]]

#### Reaction with Aldehyde, Ketone 
Formation of Imine (Schiff's Base) with pri. amine and formation of enamine with sec. amine. 

Here, just like two OH on the same C are unstable due to lp-lp repulsions, OH and N containing FG are also unstable due to lp-lp repulsions.

#### Hoffman's Mustard Oil Reaction 
aka **pri. amine test.**
#named_reaction 

Pri. amine is reacted with $\ce{ CS_{2} }$.

The mustard smell is due to formation of isothiocyanate.

#### Hinsberg Reagent Test 
It is test of pri. and sec. amines. 

#named_reaction 

Amine is reacted with Benzene sulphonyl chloride (Hinsberg reagent) to form sulphamide which is water insoluble. This sulphamide is then reacted with KOH which then forms a water soluble salt.

#### Carbyl amine Reaction 
aka **Isocyanide test**

Isocyanide is also called carbyl amine and has a foul smell.

It is test of pri. amine. 

#mechanism is like [[03.5 Phenol Named Reactions#Reimer Teimann Reaction]]

#### Reaction with Nitrous Acid 
##### With pri. aliphatic amine 
A diazonium intermediate is formed which is unstable because diazonium is unstable with aliphatic. 

This unstable diazonium salt, loses the nitrogen to form carbocation. This carbocation then forms various products. 

Generally, the alcohol is major.

This is what happens in [[00 Elimination Reactions#Semi Pinacol Pinacolone Rearrangement]].

With amide, carboxylic acid is formed.

##### With sec. aliphatic amine 
It forms dialkyl nitroso amine which is a yellow oily liquid.

##### With tert. aliphatic amine 
It forms a salt. On heating, the smallest R group is removed in the form of alcohol and again dialkyl nitroso amine is formed.

##### With pri. aromatic amine 
Diazotisation reaction happens.

[[02 Benzene Diazonium Salt#Formation by Diazotisation]]

![[Pasted image 20240102164810.png]]

##### With sec. aromatic amine 
Just like with sec. aliphatic amine, a yellow oily liquid is formed.

##### With tert. aromatic amine 
$\ce{ NO+ }$ acts as electrophile and does electrophilic substitution at the p position.

### Reaction given by only Aliphatic Amine 
Pri. aliphatic amine on reaction with NOCl (Nitrosyl Chloride aka **Tyldane reagent**) forms alkyl chloride. 

#mechanism is similar to that of diazotisation.

### Reaction given by only Aromatic Amine 
[[02 Benzene Diazonium Salt#Coupling Reaction]]

[[01 Nitration and Sulphonation]]
[[02 Halogenation]]
