# E1CB and Ei Elimination
## E1CB Elimination
aka **Unimolecular Conjugate Base Elimination**

It is a two step reaction. 

It is opposite of E1, in which the H is removed first forming anion and then lg is removed. 

For $\ce{ E_{1CB} }$ reaction, $\beta$ H of lg should be acidic.

It occurs on heating with strong base.

It is called unimolecular because RDS is 1st order. 

**Chemical Kinetics of this reaction,**
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
Rate of E_{1CB} &= Rate of RDS \\
&= k_{1}. [CB] \\
\\
Now, \\
k_{eq} &= \frac{ [CB] }{ [R-X] [Base] } \\
\\
Giving,\\
\\
Rate of E_{1CB} &= k_{1}. k_{eq} [R-X] [Base]
 }
\end{split}
$$
Thus it is a 2nd order reaction. 

Rearrangement is not possible since intermediate is anion. 

E1CB is a non stereospecific reaction. 

Since C-H bond is not broken in RDS, kinetic isotopic effect is not applicable. 

Here Saytzeff or Hoffman is not important as the more acidic H is the one which is removed. 

Weak leaving groups are more favourable towards $\ce{ E_{1CB} }$. This is because there is a chance of $\ce{ E_{1} }$ occurring if lg is good. 

In $\ce{ E_{1CB} }$ reaction, 1st step is acid base equilibrium. So, in presence of $\ce{ OD- + D_{2}O }$ or $\ce{ OR- + ROD }$, [[03 Tautomerism#Deuterium Exchange|deuterium exchange]] is possible on $\beta$ position of lg.

## Ei Elimination
**Internal Elimination**

It is possible only in presence of specific leaving groups. 
Like,

Here, base is not required. 
Just heating works and thermal decomposition happens (aka *pyrolysis*). 
**Pyrolysis** means thermal decomposition in absence of air.


Ei is stereospecific and is syn elimination with cyclic syn periplanar transition state. [[01 E2 Elimination#Stereochemistry|(In case of E2)]]

#mechanism forms eclipsed conformation,

Since there is no formation of carbocation, rearrangement is not possible. 

Kinetic Isotopic effect is applicable as everything happens in one step. 

Major product is Hoffman product as the least crowded H is removed (cyclic TS is favourable in low steric hinderance).

It is a 1st order reaction. 

##### Pyrolysis of Ester
Forms Alkene and carboxylic acid.

##### Pyrolysis of Xanthate Ester
Xanthate ester is $\ce{ R-S-(C=S)-O-R }$

This reaction is called **Chugaev Elimination.** #named_reaction 

Only the least crowded $\beta$ H of the R connected with O will be removed.
