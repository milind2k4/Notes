# E2 Elimination 
aka **Bimolecular Elimination**

It is a single step mechanism.

Strong base on high temp. is its favourable condition.

In dehydrohalogenation, we use the following strong bases,

#mechanism of $\ce{ E_{2} }$,

It is a 2nd order reaction and thus,
$$\ce{ Rate \propto [R-X] [Base] }$$

Since no carbocation is formed, there is no rearrangement. 

In $\ce{ E_{2} }$ elimination, generally, Saytzeff product is major. This is called **Zaitsev's/Saytzeff rule.**

E2 and SN2 are parallel Reactions, i.e. they occur simultaneously. 
As we increase temp. the amount of E2 product formed is increased. 
In tertiary, elimination is favourable and in primary, SN2. However, if it is heated then make elimination product.

If there are no H at $\beta$ position, there will be no reaction.

#### Energy Level Diagram

Reactivity is proportional to stability of transition state, which in turn depends on stability of product.

#### Reactivity 
Reactivity. increases with leaving group ability. 
$$\ce{ R-I > R-Br > R-Cl > R-F }$$

Reactivity wrt degree of alkyl halides, $\ce{ 3^{\circ} > 2^{\circ} > 1^{\circ} }$.

Here, kinetic isotopic effect (KIE) is applicable.

![[Pasted image 20231206211223.png]]

Between Saytzeff effect and KIE, stability of alkene is more important. Thus, Saytzeff > KIE.

#### Stereochemistry 
E2 elimination is stereospecific, anti elimination reaction in which anti periplanar (same plane opposite side) staggered transition state is formed. 

This is because the base which is e rich can only attack from the opposite side of X, which is also e rich. 

![[Pasted image 20231206213011.png]]

If there are no H on the opposite side of X, E2 elimination will not happen.

Here we will go opposite of [[00 Reaction Mechanisms#Short Trick for Stereospecific Reactions|CAT etc.]] i.e.,
**Anti Elimination of Threo forms Cis**

The groups which are on the vertical line will be the ones deciding cis and trans.

#### Hoffman Major Product 
In E2 elimination, generally Saytzeff product is formed in major amount. But in presence of following conditions, Hoffman product is major.
1. In presence of bulky base.
2. In presence of strong EW leaving group like $\ce{ -F, -NR_{3}+, SR_{2}+ }$
3. When $\upgamma$ position is highly crowded. 


**In presence of bulky base,** least crowded $\beta$ H will eliminate due to steric hinderance. Here steric hinderance took priority. 

Bulky bases like tert alkoxide or tert. amine.

**In presence of strong EW l.g,** more acidic $\beta$ H will eliminate. Here stability of carbanion took priority. 

In Hoffman elimination, only KOH can be used.

As EW power increases in lg, the %age of Hoffman product is increased.

vicinal or geminal can form alkyne on adding sodium amide, $\ce{ NaNH_{2} }$.
![[Pasted image 20231213164030.png]]

If terminal alkyne is formed, then acid base reaction will also occur if possible.
