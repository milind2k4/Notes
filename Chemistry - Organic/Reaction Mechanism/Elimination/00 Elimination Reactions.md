# Elimination Reactions
The reverse of addition is elimination.

They are endothermic reactions and thus high temp. is favourable. 

Types of elimination reactions,
- On the basis of relative positions of eliminant groups,
	1. $\alpha$-Elimination 
	1. $\beta$-Elimination
		1. $\ce{ E_{1} }$ 
		1. $\ce{ E_{2} }$ 
		1. $\ce{ E_{1CB} }$ 
		1. $\ce{ E_{i} }$ 
	3. $\upgamma$-Elimination 
	$\\$

- On the basis of stereochemistry of elimination,
	1. **Syn Elimination:** Elimination of two groups from same plane.
	1. **Anti Elimination:** Elimination of two groups from opposite planes.

#### 1,1-Elimination
I.e. $\alpha$-Elimination.

Elimination of two groups from the same position.

![[Pasted image 20231206203537.png]]
(formation of carbene form chloroform)

#### 1,2-Elimination
I.e. $\beta$-Elimination.

Elimination of two groups from adjacent position.

This elimination always results in pi bond and it represents elimination in general. 

The result is **Saytzeff product,** which has more alkyl groups and is thus *more stable* and **Hoffman product,** which has less alkyl groups. 

If only one product is formed, then it cannot be called either Saytzeff or Hoffman.

#### 1,3-Elimination
I.e. $\upgamma$-Elimination.

Elimination of two groups from first and third position.

This elimination results in 3 membered ring formation.

#### 1,4-Elimination 
aka **Conjugate Elimination.**

If the H with halogen is on $sp^{2}$ C, then its conjugated H is removed.

## E1 Elimination
aka **Unimolecular Elimination**

![[Pasted image 20231213171038.png]]

SN1 and E1 are parallel reactions. I.e. they occur simultaneously. 
It occurs in the presence of weak base. 

It is a two step mechanism same as SN1.
First step of E1 is the same as SN1, i.e. ionisation step. 

#mechanism involves formation of carbocation intermediate.
![[Pasted image 20231213171334.png]]

Since carbocation is intermediate, rearrangement is possible. 

Rate of reaction, does not depend on concentration of base.
$$\ce{ Rate \propto [alkyl halide] }$$
Thus it is a 1st order reaction. 

Polar protic solvent is favourable.

E1 is non stereospecific and kinetic isotopic effect is not applicable as C-H bond is not broken in RDS. 

Major product is generally, Saytzeff. 

Reactivity is directly proportional to stability of carbocation intermediate. Thus,
![[Pasted image 20231213171912.png]]

Also, reactivity is directly proportional to leaving group ability. 
$$\ce{ R-I > R-Br > R-Cl > R-F (no E_{1}) }$$

In alkyl halides, generally, $\ce{ S_{N}1 > E_{1} }$.

### Dehydration of Alcohol
![[Pasted image 20231216201208.png]]

Dehydrating agent used are,
$$
\begin{split}
\left.\begin{matrix}
\ce{ 
conc. H_{2}SO_{4}, \Delta  \\
conc. H_{3}PO_{4}, \Delta 
 }
\end{matrix}\right\} & \ce{\ mainly E_{1} } 
\\
\\
\left.\begin{matrix}
\ce{ 
\underset{ alumina }{ Al_{2}O_{3} }, \Delta  \\
P_{2}O_{5}, \Delta 
 }
\end{matrix}\right\} & \ce{\ mainly E_{2} } 
\\
\\
\left.
\begin{matrix}
\ce{ 
ThO_{2}, \Delta  \\
WO_{2}, \Delta 
 }
\end{matrix}
\right\} & \ce{\ E_{2} with Hoffman major } 
\end{split}
$$

With $\ce{ ThO_{2} and WO_{2} }$ Hoffman product is major because they are large in size and thus steric hinderance is to be considered. 

![[Pasted image 20231216202237.png]]


In primary alcohol, reaction with $\ce{ conc. H_{2}SO_{4} }$ is actually $\ce{ E_{2} }$ but the major product is the same as that formed when $\ce{ E_{1} }$ happens.

Formation of diethyl ether here is called **Williamson's Continuous Ether Synthesis.** And it is a laboratory method of preparation of diethyl ether.

#### Pinacol Pinacolone Rearrangement 
#named_reaction 

Pinacol is a vic diol. And Pinacolone is a ketone. 

#mechanism 
![[Pasted image 20231216205403.png]]

In first step, cation forms at the place where it is most stable.

Migratory aptitude for Pinacol - Pinacolone rearrangement is different than other rearrangements,
$$\ce{ Ph > H > D > Alkyl }$$
$$\ce{ 3^{\circ} > 2^{\circ} > 1^{\circ} }$$
Migratory aptitude for aryl rings is proportional to e density on it.
Between o and p isomers, o has very less migratory aptitude.

![[Pasted image 20231216211945.png]]

![[Pasted image 20231216210652.png]]

Configuration of chiral C in the migratory group remains the same after migration.

##### Semi Pinacol Pinacolone Rearrangement 
It is when the reactant is not vic. diol, but the cation is formed without protonation.

![[Pasted image 20231216213045.png]]

#### Dehalogenation in Vicinal Dihalides 
They are mainly E2 elimination and thus is stereospecific. 

![[Pasted image 20231228164758.png]]

#mechanism 
![[Pasted image 20231228165004.png]]

This can even form Triple bond.

![[Pasted image 20231228192258.png]]

Examples,
![[Pasted image 20231228205257.png]]

#### Other Dehalogenations 
When there are 3 halogen on the same C, we use silver instead of Zinc to form triple bond. 

Also, the possibility of intramolecular reaction is more than that of intermolecular.
