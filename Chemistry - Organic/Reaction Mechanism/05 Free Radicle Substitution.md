# $\ce{ S_{FR} }$ Reactions 
Free radicles are highly reactive and they are readily formed in presence of other FR.

Initiators for free radicle reactions are peroxides because they can easily form FR. 

$$\ce{ \underset{ perether }{ R-O-O-R }, H-O-O-H, \underset{ perester }{ R-COO-OOC-R }, \underset{ azo comp. }{ R-N=R }, AIBN }$$
AIBN is

**FR inhibitors:**

$\ce{ O_{2} }$ absorbs FR and forms peroxide. 
Benzoquinone also absorbs FR.

## Halogenation 
### On Saturated C 
[[02 Monochlorination]]

![[Pasted image 20231007184720.png]]

Reactivity of Halogens:
$$\ce{ F_{2} > Cl_{2} > Br_{2} > I_{2} }$$
Fluorination is a very fast and highly exothermic reaction. It releases so much energy that the bonds of the products start dissociating. 
For fluorination suitable conditions are: low temp., dark room, in presence of inert gases. 

Iodination is a very slow and reversible reaction and it is more favourable in backward direction because HI by product is strong reducing agent. 
For iodination we use strong oxidising reagents like $\ce{ HNO_{3}, HIO_{3}, HgO }$. With $\ce{ HIO_{3} }$ HI does comproportionation reaction and forms iodine. 
$$\ce{ 5HI + HIO_{3} -> 3I_{2} + 3H_{2}O  }$$

##### Polyhalogenation 
There will most likely by poly halogenated product because if there is H on the C and halogen remaining it will substitute it. Like [[03 Fridal Craft Reactions and More#Friedel Craft Alkylation|FC Alkylation.]]

If we take more halogen then poly halogenated product will be major and if we take more alkane then mono halogenated product will be major.

#### Mechanism 
#mechanism 

It is a chain reaction type reaction. 

*Note* that H radicle does not form as its activation energy is very high. 

There are 3 steps. 
1. **Chain Initiation** in which homolysis happens. Endothermic.
2. **Chain Propagation** in which reaction goes forward. Endothermic (Exothermic for F).
3. **Chain Termination** in which radicles start to combine.  Exothermic.

![[Pasted image 20231007191503.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231007191515.png]]

Thus RDS is exothermic for F and endothermic for others. 

Also, since in RDS, C-H bond is breaking Kinetic Isotopic effect is applicable on halogenation.

#### Major and Minor Products 
The secondary FR is more stable and thus its monochlorinated product will be major. 

**Regioselective Reaction:** Reaction in which more than one structural isomeric products are formed in different amounts. Halogenation is RSR. (select one structure)

##### Factors Affecting Regioselectivity of Halogenation 
1. Reactivity of C-H bond: $3^{\circ}$ > $2^{\circ}$ > $1^{\circ}$ C-H
2. Stability of free radicle: $3^{\circ} > 2^{\circ} > 1^{\circ}$
3. Availability of same type of hydrogens (probability/multiplication factor). 
4. Reactivity and selectivity of halogens. 
   Reactivity: $\ce{ F^{.} > Cl^{.} > Br^{.} > I^{.} }$
   Selectivity: $\ce{ F^{.} < Cl^{.} < Br^{.} < I^{.} }$
   F can break even $1^{\circ}$ bonds. 
   
   The more reactive, the less selective about which bond it will break. 

**Relative Rates for Replacement of one H in Alkanes:**

|     | $1^{\circ}$ | $2^{\circ}$ | $3^{\circ}$ |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| F   | 1           | 1           | 1           |
| Cl  | 1           | 3.8         | 5           |
| Br  | 1           | 82          | 1600        |

The rates are relative, i.e. for F it is $1:1:1$ for reaction on $1^{\circ}$, $2^{\circ}$, $3^{\circ}$ C-H bond. 

Based on this we can calculate relative ratio:
![[Pasted image 20231007203947.png]]
(the 2 and 6 here are the respective no. of H at the positions)

We should calculate the relative ratios for reaction with Cl. 
![[Pasted image 20231007204203.png]]

However, we only calculate for non resonance stabilised FR,
![[Pasted image 20231007204242.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231007204309.png]]
(the benzyl chloride is major because the FR is resonance stabilised)

### Allylic and Benzylic Halogenation with NBS and NCS

NBS = N-Bromo Succinamide 
NCS = N-Chloro Succinamide 

![[Pasted image 20231007204553.png]]

In presence of FR initiators NBS and NCS give monohalogenation on allylic, benzylic, propargylic and $\alpha$-position of carbonyl compounds.  

![[Pasted image 20231007205011.png]]

If there is water present, then there will be nucleophilic addition
![[Pasted image 20231007210104.png]]

#### Mechanism 
#mechanism 

It has the same 3 steps, Chain Initiation, Propagation and Termination.

![[Pasted image 20231007205142.png]]

The concentration of Br formed is very low and thus there is only monobromination. 

#### Example Reactions 
Also there will be resonance so there might be more than one product,

![[Pasted image 20231007205625.png]]

In $\ce{ S_{FR} }$ we always make more stable product. 
![[Pasted image 20231007205721.png]]
(more stable product due to hyperconjugation)

### Hunsdieker Reaction 
Silver salt of carboxylic acid is reacted with bromine (also Cl, I but they have low yield) in presence of $\ce{ CCl_{4} }$, then R-Br is formed. 

It is a degradation reaction as it reduces one C.

Examples,

## Kolbe's Electrolysis
#named_reaction 

Of Salt of Carboxylic acid. 

Anode releases $\ce{ CO_{2} }$ and cathode $\ce{ H_{2} }$.

![[Pasted image 20231007210811.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231007210931.png]]

If there is head on collision (called *coupling*) then R-R is formed. If there is head to tail collision (disproportionation) then there will be alkane and alkene formed in pairs. 

![[Pasted image 20231007211855.png]]

Generally the coupling product is major. However, if there is more crowding (i.e. R = $3^{\circ}$) then the major will be head to tail collision one because of steric hinderance.

#### Examples 
![[Pasted image 20231007211844.png]]

**Intramolecular reactions:** If there are two FR in the same molecule, there will always be intramolecular reaction.

(succinate)

![[Pasted image 20231007212458.png]]
(glutarate, malate and fumarate)

If there is resonance then the product may not have ring,
![[Pasted image 20231007212742.png]]

If [[04 Intermediates and their Stability#Types of Intermediates|Benzyne]] is formed then there is polymerisation and rings consisting of benzenes will be formed.

(triphenylene and tetraphenylene)
