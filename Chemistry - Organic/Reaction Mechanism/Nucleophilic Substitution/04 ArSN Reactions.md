# SN reactions of Aryl Halides
They are of 3 types:
- $\ce{ ArS_{N}1 }$, given by benzene diazonium salt. 
- $\ce{ ArS_{N}2 }$, when strong EWG are present on o/p position of leaving group. 
- Benzyne mechanism, in presence of strong base on heating.

Formation of Phenol, (phenoxide) via **Dow's Process.** It occurs via benzyne mechanism. #named_reaction

As we increase EWG, the reaction occurs more easily. 

If there are 3 nitro groups, then only heating it with water makes picric acid.

#### $\ce{ ArS_{N}2 }$ Reactions 
 Generally, aryl halides do not give nucleophilic reaction.

But if there is EWG on o/p positions, strong nucleophile will react reluctantly. 
And for reaction to occur, stability: $\ce{ X- > Nu- }$.

#mechanism happens in two steps. First is addition of Nu and breaking of aromaticity. Second is removal of $\ce{ X- }$.

Reactivity increases with stability of anion intermediate

Reactivity wrt X,
$$\ce{ Ar-F > Ar-Cl > Ar-Br > Ar-I }$$
This is due to +ve charge on C bonded with halogen. 


It is a second order reaction because,
$$\ce{ Rate \propto [Ar-X] [Nu-] }$$

SN2 reaction takes preference over ArSN2.
