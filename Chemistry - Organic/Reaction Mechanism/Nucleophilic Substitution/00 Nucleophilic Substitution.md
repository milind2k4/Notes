# Nucleophilic Substitution
A general $\ce{ S_{N} }$ reaction is,

$\ce{ S_{N}1 }$ means **Unimolecular Nuclear Substitution.**
$\ce{ S_{N}2 }$ means **Bimolecular Nuclear Substitution.**


Reactivity is directly proportional to leaving group ability. 
Thus,
$$\ce{ R-I > R-Br > R-Cl > R-F }$$
where $\ce{ R-F }$ does not react.

#### General Notes 
Generally nucleophilic substitution reactions are not possible when lg is present on C-C multiple bond due to high $\pi$ e density.

In presence of $\ce{ Ag+, Hg^{2+} }$ ions, $\ce{ S_{N}1 }$ reaction is more feasible for alkyl halide because they from ppt with halide and favour formation of carbo cation. 
$$\ce{ R-Cl + Ag+ -> R+ + \underset{ white }{ AgCl } v }$$

But the cation must be stable. I.e. bridge head X will not be removed.

### SN reactions of Ethers 
#### Reaction with HX
If HX is added in excess, the alcohol formed is converted to R-X.

Reactivity of HX: $\ce{ HI > HBr \gg HCl > HF }$

When any R group is tert. or benzylic, $\ce{ S_{N}1 }$ reaction occurs. Otherwise, $\ce{ S_{N}2 }$ reaction occurs. 

With anhydrous HI, it shows $\ce{ S_{N}2 }$ with any ether as it is very good nucleophile.

If there is SN2 reaction, then $\ce{ X- }$ will attack on lesser crowded C.

If there is SN1 reaction, then $\ce{ X- }$ will attack on the C which has the most stable carbocation.

#### Hydrolysis
[[04 Hydrolysis#Hydrolysis of Ether]]


Only possible in acidic medium and in most cases is $\ce{ S_{N}1 }$. 

If both Rs are pri., then $\ce{ S_{N}2 }$ reaction happens. 

Carbocation is formed of the cation which is more stable.

#### Reaction with $\ce{ PCl_{5} }$
Two R-Cl are formed. First the smaller R is made into alkyl halide and the other into alcohol. Then it attacks on the formed alcohol to form another R-Cl.

### SN reactions of Epoxide
Since epoxides have high ring strain, it is highly reactive. 

Thus it gives reaction in both acidic and basic medium. 

![[Pasted image 20231202190518.png]]

#mechanism in acidic is $\ce{ S_{N}2 }$ with attack on more crowded C.

#mechanism in basic is $\ce{ S_{N}2 }$. 
![[Pasted image 20231202191057.png]]

Remember: is it in basic or with strong nucleophile? if yes then reaction is SN2 and attack will be on less crowded atom.
