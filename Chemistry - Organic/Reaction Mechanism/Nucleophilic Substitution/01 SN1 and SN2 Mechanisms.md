# SN1 and SN2 Mechanisms

### $\ce{ S_{N}1 }$ Reaction
It has a min. of 2 steps. 

#mechanism consists of formation of carbocation. 
![[Pasted image 20231115195129.png]]
Rearrangement is possible and major product is the one of most stable cation. 
![[Pasted image 20231115201900.png]]

Rate of Reaction,
$$\ce{ Rate \propto [R-X]^{1} }$$
Thus it is a first order reaction. 

Weak nucleophile (neutral) favour this reaction.

Here [[01 Introduction and Definitions#Polar Protic|polar protic]] solvent is used.

Solvolysis (like hydrolysis but with other solvents) of alkyl halides are $\ce{ S_{N}1 }$ reaction as solvent is weak nucleophile.

##### Reactivity 
Reactivity of Various Alkyl Halides is directly proportional to Stability of Carbocation intermediate formed in RDS.

If there are 2 or more alkyl groups on $\beta$ position, it is called $\beta-$crowded and it facilitates reaction. $\beta$-crowded even primary alkyl halide can show $\ce{ S_{N}1 }$ reaction. 

**Compounds which don't Give $\ce{ S_{N}1 }$:** 
- pri. alkyl halide without $\beta$-crowding
- halogen connected to multiple bond or aromatic ring. This is because no stable cation is formed, there is multiple bond character between C and X and C-C multiple bond has more $\pi$ e density and thus nucleophile does not attack.
- If cation formed is highly unstable, like with anti-aromatic, bridge head, good -M group is connected etc.

#### Stereochemistry
When leaving group is bonded with chiral carbon, more than one stereoisomeric products are formed (generally two enantiomers). 

This is due to formation of planar carbocation.

**Retention** product is one which has Nu on the same side as lg.
**Inversion** product is one which has Nu on the opposite side as lg.

Generally inversion product is formed in major amount because just as lg is removed it does not move away far enough for Nu to be able to attack from its side i.e. it takes time for lg to go away.

### $\ce{ S_{N}2 }$ Reaction
It is a single step reaction. 
It is a **Concerted** reaction. 
A concerted step is one where bond breaking and bond formation take place simultaneously. 

#mechanism consists of formation of transition state.
![[Pasted image 20231115195616.png]]
Rearrangement is not possible. 
![[Pasted image 20231115201918.png]]

Rate of Reaction,
$$\ce{ Rate \propto [R-X]^{1} [Nu-]^{1} }$$
Thus it is a 2nd order reaction. 

Strong nucleophile (anionic) favour this reaction. 
Some strong nucleophile are neutral also, like ammonia, amines and $\ce{ R_{3}P }$.

Here [[01 Introduction and Definitions#Polar Aprotic|polar aprotic]] solvent is used as it increases nucleophilicity. 

##### Reactivity 
Reactivity,
- decreases with steric hinderance on C of lg
- increases with presence of EWG (-I)
- increases with partial +ve charge on C (more $\delta^{+}$)

General Order,
![[Pasted image 20231120190152.png]]
(pri. $\beta$-crowded gives reaction)

**Compounds which don't give $\ce{ S_{N}2 }$:**
- tert. alkyl halide 
- more $\beta$-crowded pri. alkyl halide (3 R groups) 
- halogen connected to multiple bonded. Reason is the same as in $\ce{ S_{N}1 }$. 
- Bridge Head because backside attack cannot happen.

#### Stereochemistry
When lg is bonded with chiral C in $\ce{ S_{N}2 }$ reaction, only inversion product is formed as Nu attacks from the back side only. This process is called **Walden Inversion.**

The specific rotation of the product formed is not the -ve of that of the reactant as it is not an enantiomer of reactant but a different compound entirely. 

![[Pasted image 20231115210017.png]]

A trigonal bipyramidal transition state is formed.

The favourability of mechanism depends on many factors. 
In the below example, the conditions are the same but since there is too much crowding on the first one, $\ce{ S_{N}2 }$ reaction could not occur there.
