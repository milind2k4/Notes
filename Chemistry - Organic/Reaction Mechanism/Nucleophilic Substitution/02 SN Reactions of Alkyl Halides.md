# SN Reactions of Alkyl Halides 

#### [[02.5 General Reactions]]

#### Williamson's Ether Synthesis (WES)
Alcohol is reacted with base to form alkoxide which is a strong base and a strong nucleophile. 

Now, this alkoxide will react with pri. or sec. alkyl halide through $\ce{ S_{N}2 }$ mechanism to form ether.

If the alkyl halide is tertiary, then elimination happens and alkene is formed. 

#mechanism

The base removes one $\alpha$-H and X to form alkene.

Since acid base reaction occurs first, the product depends on the amount of base added. 

If base is added in trace or catalytic amounts, it is exhausted and thus does not attack the substrate.

If base is added in excess amount, the base attacks the substrate. 
![[Pasted image 20231129175801.png]]

Thus, in case of excess base, consider the nucleophilicity of both the base and the alkoxide. 


This cannot happen in $\ce{ S_{N}1 }$ as there, the amount of nucleophile is of more importance than their strengths because of formation of carbocation in the reaction.

#### SN reactions of Ambidentate Nucleophiles 
With KCN, -CN gets added and with AgCN, -NC gets added. 

With $\ce{ KNO_{2} }$, -ONO gets added and with $\ce{ AgNO_{2} }$, -NO$_{2}$ gets added.

Remember that *with Ag, bond is formed with N.*

#### Halogen Exchange on Alkyl Halides
**Finkelstein and Swarts Reaction** #named_reaction 

These reactions are $\ce{ S_{N}2 }$.

Finkelstein reaction occurs because NaI is soluble in Acetone. NaBr and NaCl are not soluble and thus form ppt. This decreases the concentration of Na in the solution which pushes the reaction forward according to Le Chatilier's Principle.

Swarts reaction occurs due to the same reason. AgF is soluble in water but AgCl, AgBr or AgI are not. Precipitation reaction occurs very fast and thus reaction moves forward.

#### Ammonolysis of Alkyl halides
Pri. amine, sec. amine, tert. amine and Quaternary Salt are formed on heating pri. or sec. alkyl halide with ammonia.

Tert. halide undergo elimination and alkene is formed. 
![[Pasted image 20231129184332.png]]

Reaction is $\ce{ S_{N}2 }$ because N, even neutral, is a strong nucleophile.

If ammonia is taken in excess, pri. amine is major product. 
If alkyl halide is taken in excess, quaternary salt is major product.

#### SN reactions given by Organometallic Compounds
The alkyl of organometallic compound is substituted for the halide of alkyl halide. 

![[Pasted image 20231129184817.png]]

Here as well, tert. alkyl halide gives elimination reaction.

#### Intramolecular SN2 reactions 
Intramolecular reaction takes preference over intermolecular because it is more favourable thermodynamically. 

When lg and strong nucleophile site are present on same molecule, then intramolecular SN2 reaction takes place. 

All kinds of rings and double bonds can be formed.

#### Wurtz Reaction
#named_reaction 

[[05 Free Radicle Substitution#Kolbe's Electrolysis]]

The alkyl part of alkyl halide is doubled. Dry ether is taken as solvent. 

![[Pasted image 20231129192819.png]]

There are two #mechanism: radical and ionic. Ionic mechanism is SN2. In pri., ionic mechanism occurs. 

![[Pasted image 20231129192809.png]]

If alkyl is tertiary of alkyl halide, elimination occurs and alkene is formed along with disproportionation products.

**Intramolecular Wurtz reaction:**
(somewhat unstable compunds can also be formed)

For compounds containing more than 6 C in chain, polymer is formed.

If double bond is between two bromine, conjugated diene is formed.
