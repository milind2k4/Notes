# SN reactions of Alcohols 
#### Reaction with HX
Water is removed and X is attached to the R group. 
$\ce{ H_{2}O }$ is a good lg. as it is neutral.

#mechanism 
![[Pasted image 20231130214215.png]]

Both $\ce{ S_{N}1 }$ and $\ce{ S_{N}2 }$ can occur depending on the R group. 

If tert., sec., benzylic, allylic, $\beta$-crowded alcohol, then it reacts via $\ce{ S_{N}1 }$ mechanism. 

If pri. alcohol, then reacts via $\ce{ S_{N}2 }$ mechanism. 

**Reactivity of HX:**
$$\ce{ HI > HBr \gg HCl > HF }$$

[[05 Detection of FG#Alcohols]]

$\ce{ ZnCl_{2} }$ of Lucas reagent being a Lewis acid, makes coordinate bond with the lp of O of alc. and thus Cl can attack. The R-Cl formed in the reaction gives white turbidity.

We can convert $\ce{ -OH^{-} }$ into a good lg,

#### Reaction with $\ce{ PX_{3}, PX_{5} }$

Mainly $\ce{ S_{N}2 }$ reaction occurs. Except with tert. alcohol, which shows $\ce{ S_{N}1 }$ as it cannot show $\ce{ S_{N}2 }$.

#### Reaction with $\ce{ SOCl_{2}, SOBr_{2} }$

This is called **Darzen's Process.** #named_reaction 
It is used in industrial preparation of HCl.

With ether, reaction occurs via $\ce{ S_{N}i }$ mechanism and only retention product is formed. 

With Pyridine, reaction occurs via $\ce{ S_{N}2 }$ mechanism and only inversion product is formed.

Unless written, take solvent as ether. 

##### SNi 
#mechanism consists of formation of 4 membered cyclic transition state. 

Since both O and Cl are leaving and joining from the same side, only retention product is formed.
