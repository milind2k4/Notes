# Nucleophilic Addition ($\ce{ A_{N} }$)
Characteristic Reactions of polar multiple bond containing compounds.  
Aldehydes, ketone, imine, S=O and cyanide show them.

General reaction is:
![[Pasted image 20230916083736.png]]

The slow step is the addition of Nu i.e. rate depends on conc. of Nu and thus it is called nucleophilic addition. 

### Mechanism 
#mechanism 

It occurs in both acidic and basic medium. 

![[Pasted image 20230916083749.png]]
(RDS means rate determining step)

The addition of Nu requires more energy thus it is the slow step. 

### Factors Affecting Reactivity
of $\ce{ A_{N} }$ reactions.

Reactivity increases with:
- Nucleophilicity of nucleophile
- e deficiency on C of C=O bond. 
- presence of EWG (-M, -I)

Reactivity decreases with:
- presence of EDG (+M, +HC, +I) 
- Steric hinderance on C of C=O bond.

(Chloral)

Aliphatic carbonyl compounds are more reactive than aromatic. 
![[Pasted image 20230916083904.png]]

Cyclic are more reactive than acyclic due to there being less steric hinderance and more ring strain.

### Stereochemistry of Nu Addition 

The Nu has two pathways to attack and depending on that it forms enantiomers. 

![[Pasted image 20230916083955.png]]

If there is any other chiral C, then it will not be affected i.e. its configuration will remain the same. Thus a mix. of diastereomers is formed. 

![[Pasted image 20230916084012.png]]

It is not always necessary that it forms optically active compound. It may also form geometrical isomers. 

![[Pasted image 20230916084025.png]]

If the 3d structure is not given, then assume that the given compound is a mixture.

### General Nu Addition Reactions of Aldehyde and Ketone 
##### Addition of Water 
(Formation of hydrate)

Geminal diol is formed. This is also called hydrate of carbonyl compound. 

![[Pasted image 20230916084106.png]]

They are generally unstable due to lp lp repulsion. 

Stability of Hydrate decreases with steric hinderance.

Some hydrates of carbonyl compounds are stable:
![[Pasted image 20230916084127.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230916084142.png]]

The main reason for stability is H bonding. Ninhydrin is also stable. 

##### Addition of Alcohols 
Only happens in acidic medium. Dry acid is used. If water is present then hydrolysis happens and the substrate is formed back. 

**Hemiacetal or hemiketal** is formed which reacts again to form **acetal or ketal.** 

![[Pasted image 20230916084243.png]]

Ringed compounds can also be formed,

##### Reaction with HCN 
(Formation of Cyanohydrins)

![[Pasted image 20230916084312.png]]

##### Addition of Alkylide 
Alkylide is when we remove H from terminal alkyne. 

![[Pasted image 20230916084323.png]]

##### Addition of Sodium Bisulfite 
There is inter-molecular acid base reaction to form weaker acid and base. 

![[Pasted image 20230916084345.png]]

White solid ppt is formed.

This is used to test aldehyde and ketones which have Methyl one side (small ketones). 
Higher ketones do not give reaction. 

On heating the salt with acid or base, we get the original compound back.

##### Reaction with $\ce{ LiAlH_{4}, NaBH_{4} }$
Here $\ce{ H- }$ is the nucleophile. H from $\ce{ LiAlH_{4} }$ is stronger nucleophile than $\ce{ NaBH_{4} }$

Alcohol is formed. 

![[Pasted image 20230916084636.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230916084816.png]]

If aldehyde is taken, then primary alcohol is formed.
If Ketone is taken, then secondary alcohol is formed.

##### Reaction with Organometallic Compounds 
Reaction with RMgX, RLi. 
No reaction with $\ce{ R_{2}CuLi, R_{2}Cd }$ because the -ve charge is less one it than compared to Mg and Li. 

Here the R bonded with metal acts as nucleophile. On hydrolysis alcohol is formed. 

![[Pasted image 20230916085214.png]]
formation of $\ce{ R-Li, R_{2}CuLi (Gilmann's reagent), R_{2}Cd }$

RLi is most reactive among these. 

#### $\ce{ A_{N} }$ reactions given by Organometallic Compounds 
- **With aldehyde and Ketones:**
	![[Pasted image 20230916085558.png]]
	
	If there is aldehyde and halogen in the same compound, then on reaction with Mg, GR reacts intra-molecularly. Intramolecular nucleophile addition reaction takes place.

- **With $\ce{ CO_{2} }$ (dry ice):** $\ce{ A_{N} }$ happens only once. 
  
  Carboxylic acid is formed.

- **With $\ce{ O_{2} }$ (air):** This is not $\ce{ A_{N} }$ reaction. #important 
  
  On hydrolysis alcohol is formed.

#### $\ce{ A_{N} }$ reactions of Cyanide 
On partial hydrolysis (or hydrolysis at room temp.) amide is formed. 
On complete hydrolysis carboxylic acid is formed. 

On reaction with $\ce{ LiALH_{4} }$ amine is formed. 
It does not react with $\ce{ NaBH_{4} }$.

![[Pasted image 20230916091140.png]]

On reaction with GR, ketone is formed.
