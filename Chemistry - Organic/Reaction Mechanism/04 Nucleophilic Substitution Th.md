# $\ce{ S_{N}2_{Th} }$ Reactions 
It is also called Acyl $\ce{ S_{N}2 }$ reaction. 

Mainly given by carboxylic acid and its derivates. Also given by sulphonic acid and its derivates. 
![[Pasted image 20230916200813.png]]

The $\ce{ R-CO- }$ group is called **Acyl.**

A general reaction is,
![[Pasted image 20230916200822.png]]

The condition for this reaction is that the leaving group needs to be more stable than the nucleophile. 
i.e.,
$$\ce{ L- > Nu- }$$
Or Nu should be more basic.

Otherwise the Nu will be removed while O forms its double bond. 

### Mechanism 
#mechanism 

In first step, nucleophilic addition takes place and $sp^{2}$ C becomes $sp^{3}$. In 2nd step the $\ce{ O- }$ makes its double bond and the leaving group is removed. 

Step one is the RDS. And since Nu is being added in that step, it is $\ce{ S_{N} }$ reaction.

The Th represents the tetrahedral structure formed in the intermediate.

The rate of reaction,
$$\ce{ Rate \propto [R-COOL]^{1}[Nu]^{1} }$$
and thus it is a 2nd order reaction, and thus the 2 in $\ce{ S_{N}2_{Th} }$.

This mechanism is also called *Addition Eliminatio.*

### Energy Level Diagram

There is one stable intermediate and two transition states. 
First is when the Nu is making its bond and the other is when the leaving groups is leaving. 

Since TS1 requires more energy, it is the RDS.

### Factors Affecting Reactivity
of $\ce{ S_{N}2_{Th} }$ reactions

Since the Nu attacks on C connected to O, and the addition step is the RDS, the factors affecting the addition affect the rate. 

[[03 Nucleophilic Addition#Factors Affecting Reactivity]]

In addition to the above,
$$\text{reactivity} \propto \text{stability of leaving group}$$
This is more important than crowding.

(also $\ce{ Cl- }$ is more stable than $\ce{ R-CO-O- }$ because HCl is more acidic than $\ce{ R-COOH }$)

## Reactions
### General $\ce{ S_{N}2_{Th} }$ Reactions of Acid Derivatives 

We can easily make the less reactive derivative compound.

As base pyridine (py) is used. 

Examples,

##### Reaction with Sulphonic Acid Derivatives
Just like acid derivatives of carboxylic acid, acid derivates of sulphonic acid also gives the same kind of reactions. However, here tetrahedral intermediate is not formed.

##### Reaction of Tosylchloride
![[Pasted image 20230916210623.png]]

##### Haloform Reaction 
If there are 3 X on C, then it becomes a good leaving group. 

In the end haloform is formed.

![[Pasted image 20230916211249.png]]

With hydroxyl amine it gives Hydroxymic acid. 
![[Pasted image 20230916211844.png]]

With GR, RLi it gives Ketone. 

With $\ce{ LiAlH_{4}, NaBH_{4} + H_{2}O }$ it gives primary alcohols. The $\ce{ H_{2}O }$ which is added is not written above the arrow generally.

##### Hydrolysis of Ester 
Hydrolysis of esters in acidic medium is reversible. In basic medium it is irreversible. The irreversible is called **Saponification.** #named_reaction 

There are two paths, to find out we use a radioactive O in the middle (O-18). 

In general, the (CO)-O bond breaks. This occurs by $\ce{ S_{N}2_{Th} }$ mechanism. 

If the cation of $\ce{ R' }$ is highly stable (i.e. if it is tertiary or benzyl), then the O-R group breaks. This occurs by $\ce{ S_{N}1 }$ mechanism.

### $\ce{ S_{N}2_{Th} }$ Reactions of Carboxylic acid 

To form acid halide, we react carboxylic acid with $\ce{ PCl_{5}, PCl_{3} or SOCl_{2} }$ (thionyl chloride).

To form anhydride we heat it in presence of dehydrating agent like $\ce{ P_{2}O_{5} or conc. H_{2}SO_{4} }$.

![[Pasted image 20231002111920.png]]

To form ester, we heat it with alcohol in presence of dehydrating agent. This is called **Esterification.**

Reacting it with ammonia (without heating) forms ammonium carboxylate by acid base reaction. Which in turn forms amide when heated. 

If we heat it with ammonia or amine (except tertiary amine), it forms amide directly. 

![[Pasted image 20231002112649.png]]

Reaction with $\ce{ LiAlH_{4} }$ forms primary alcohol. And it does not react with $\ce{ NaBH_{4} }$. 

Only acid base reaction occurs with Grignard Reagent even if it is added in excess. 

If $\ce{ RLi }$ is added, in first step acid base reaction happens but if it is added in excess, then in the next step it forms ketone by reacting again.

###### Esterification 
In general the OH bond of the alcohol breaks. 

Reactivity increases when R is EWG and R' is EDG. 

The general #mechanism is,
![[Pasted image 20231002113519.png]]

The attack of $\ce{ R'-OH }$ is the RDS. 

#### $\ce{ S_{N}2_{Th} }$ Reactions of $\ce{ PCl_{5} }$
Amides and Alkyl Halides are formed. 

![[Pasted image 20231002114019.png]]

With carboxylic acid the #mechanism is,
![[Pasted image 20231002114451.png]]

##### Other Reactions of $\ce{ PCl_{5} }$
Other than $\ce{ S_{N}2_{Th} }$. 

The O is removed in the form of $\ce{ POCl_{3} }$ and Cl(s) are added in its place if O are present (except amide).

![[Pasted image 20231002114716.png]]

With amide, the O is still remove in the form of $\ce{ POCl_{3} }$, but the 2 H on $\ce{ -NH_{2} }$ are also removed in the form of $\ce{ HCl }$ and cyanide is formed. I.e. dehydration occurs. 

Cyanide can be formed by dehydration of amide. #important

### $\ce{ S_{N}2_{Th} }$ Reactions of Organometallic Compounds
[[02 Acid Base Reactions and GR#Reactivity]]

If one mole of OM compound is taken, then aldehyde or ketone will be formed. 

If GR of RLi is taken in excess, alcohol is formed by [[03 Nucleophilic Addition#Reaction with Organometallic Compounds|nucleophilic addition.]] If the other OM compound is taken in excess, nothing happens.

### $\ce{ S_{N}2_{Th} }$ Reactions of $\ce{ LiAlH_{4} }$ and $\ce{ NaBH_{4} }$ 
$\ce{ NaBH_{4} }$ has very low nucleophilicity. It only gives $\ce{ S_{N}2_{Th} }$ with acid halide. 

First $\ce{ S_{N}2_{Th} }$ happens and then $\ce{ A_{N} }$. Finally alcohol is formed of all the O present.
