# Introduction and Definitions

### Types of Solvent 
#### Polar ($\mu \neq 0$ )
##### Polar Protic
Where $\ce{ H+ }$ ion is formed. Generally solvents where H is connected to O, N or halogen. These undergo self ionisation. 
Examples are,

##### Polar Aprotic 
Where $\ce{ H+ }$ is not obtained. These do not undergo self ionisation.

Examples are, 
- Acetone, 
- DMSO (*dimethylsulphoxide*), 
- DMF (*N,N-dimethyl formamide*), 
- DMA (*N,N-dimethyl acetamide*), 
- HMPA (*hexamethyl phosphamide*)

- *Crown Ethers* (cyclic poly ethers like $\ce{ (-OCH_{2}-CH_{2}-)_{n} }$). They are used to capture i.e. solvate  cations.

#### Non-polar ($\mu = 0$)
Examples of non polar solvents are benzene, n-hexane, n-pentane, toluene, mesitylene (3 Me on benzene alt.), $\ce{ CCl_{4}, CS_{2} }$
   
#### Solvation
If water is used, then it is [[14 Hydrolysis]]

Polar protic solvent can solvate both cations and anions. 
![[Pasted image 20230914180610.png]]

Polar aprotic solvent can only solvate cations. This is because of crowding around +ve part of solvent.

### Types of Attacking Reagent

#### Nucleophile ($\ce{ Nu- }$)
Nucleus loving i.e. lp containing e rich species. 

Attacks on e deficient positions.

- **Negatively Charged:**

  $\\$
  
- **Neutral:** generally O or N containing.
  ![[Pasted image 20230914180756.png]]
  $\\$

- **Ambident:** (more than one donor)

#### Electrophile ($\ce{ E+ }$)
Electron loving i.e. vacant orbital containing, e deficient species.

Attacks on e rich positions. 

Note that electrophile needs to have a vacant orbital. Thus, $\ce{ NH_{4}+ }$ is not an electrophile even though it has +ve charge as it does not have a vacant orbital. 

- **Positively Charged:**
  ![[Pasted image 20230914180817.png]]
  (acylinium ion, nitronium ion)

- **Neutral:** which may have vacant p or d orbital.
  
  Vacant p orbital like in $\ce{ BX_{3} }$, borane, carbene, nitrene (which have incomplete octet), $\ce{ AlX_{3} }$ etc. 
  
  Vacant d orbital like in $\ce{ SO_{2}, SO_{3}, PCl_{5}, PCl_{3} }$. P can thus do both accepting and donating. 
  
  Some don't even have vacant orbital but have e deficiency like $\ce{ CO_{2} and CCl_{4} }$

### Nucleophilicity 
[[07 Basic Strength]]

Attacking tendency of nucleophile at e deficient position. 
It is a kinetic property i.e. related to chemical kinetics. 

**Basicity:** Tendency to accept $\ce{ H+ }$ from acid. It is a thermodynamic property i.e. related to feasibility. 

![[Pasted image 20230916210351.png]]

Generally the nucleophilicity and basicity comparison is the same for different species. 

#### Rules for Comparison 
Nucleophilicity order depends on solvent. 

1. -vely charged species are stronger nucleophile as well as stronger base wrt corresponding neutral species. 
   
   ![[Pasted image 20230914180912.png]]
   $\\$

2. When donor atoms are the same, then order of nucleophilicity and basic strength is the same. 
   
	![[Pasted image 20230914180929.png]]
	![[Pasted image 20230914180941.png]]

	There are however, some exceptions,
	![[Pasted image 20230914180954.png]]
	(2 is because there is repulsions between lps)
	$\\$

3. When donor atoms are from the same period, then on moving left to right nucleophilicity and basicity both decrease. 
   
   ![[Pasted image 20230914181014.png]]
   $\\$

4. When donor atoms are from the same group, moving from top to bottom, basicity decreases and nucleophilicity increases in polar protic solvent and decreases in polar aprotic solvent. This is due to no solvation of anion in it. #important 
   
   ![[Pasted image 20230914181028.png]]
   
   The smaller anion is more solvated (more charge density) and thus becomes more stable. 
   ![[Pasted image 20230914181046.png]]
   $\\$

5. When the donor atom is the same, then nucleophilicity is more in polar aprotic solvent. This is because anions are not solvated and thus not stabilised in polar aprotic solvent.

### Leaving Ability
This term is used for substitution reactions. 

Types:
1. **Nucleofugality:** leaving group ability for nucleophilic substitution $(\ce{ S_{N} })$. 

	![[Pasted image 20230914181214.png]]
	$\\$

2. **Electrofugality:** leaving group ability for electrophilic substitution $(\ce{ S_{E} })$. 

	![[Pasted image 20230914181221.png]]

Leaving group ability is directly proportional to the stability of leaving group. 

$$\text{leaving ability} \propto \text{stability of leaving group}$$

#### Some Leaving Groups
Some #important good leaving groups:

Tosylate ion ($\ce{ TsO- }$), Brosylate ion ($\ce{ BsO- }$)
tosyl and brosyl
![[Pasted image 20230914181257.png]]

Neutral leaving groups are generally better lg than anionic.

#### Applications
We can do a reaction by making the bad leaving group into a good one.
