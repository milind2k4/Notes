# $\ce{ A_{E} }$ Reactions
Mainly given by $\ce{ C=C and C#C }$ because they have high $\pi$ e density. And since no aromaticity is being broken, addition occurs instead of substitution. 

It is exothermic process as stronger bonds are being formed.

#### Markovnikoff's Rule
On unsymmetrical alkene/alkyne 
- Addition of +vely charged part takes place on the C of multiple bond which has more no. of H.
- Addition of -vely charged part takes place on the C of multiple bond which has less no. of H.

However, we will use mechanism to judge which product is formed. 

#### Mechanism 
#mechanism 

The addition of $\ce{ E+ }$ is RDS and thus $\ce{ A_{E} }$ reaction in both.

There are two mechanisms for $\ce{ A_{E} }$. 

Both,
- $\ce{ Rate \propto [alkene][E+] }$
- are 2nd order reaction 
- have major product as Markovnikoff's product.

##### Electrophile does not have lp
![[Pasted image 20231025115458.png]]

The cation formed is called **Classical carbonium/carbo cation ion.**
Here rearrangement is possible. 

Stereochemistry is not important as carbocation formed is planar.

Addition of $\ce{ HX, H_{2}SO_{4}, H_{2}O, R-OH }$ etc. happens through this mechanism. 

Here since carbocation is formed, in ring questions take care of [[05 Rearrangement in Carbocations#Ring Expansion|ring expansion]] and [[05 Rearrangement in Carbocations#Ring Contraction|ring contraction.]]

##### Electrophile has lp
Cyclic intermediate is formed which is not stable due to ring strain. 

Nu attacks from opposite side wrt to E.

![[Pasted image 20231025120429.png]]

The cation formed is called **Non-Classical carbonium ion or $\pi$-complex**
Here rearrangement is not possible.

It is stereoselective as well as stereospecific reaction. 
Since E and Nu are added from opposite sides, it is called **Anti-addition** (addition of two groups from opposite planes).

**Stereoselective:** Reaction in which one stereoisomeric products is formed as major product out of other possibilities. (select one stereoisomer)

**Stereospecific:** Such type of stereoselective reaction in which one of the stereoisomeric product forms as major product form a specific stereoisomer of reactant. (different stereoisomers forms different products)

Addition of $\ce{ X_{2}, X-X', H-OX, NO-Cl/Br, carbene }$ etc. happens through this mechanism. Oxymercuration and alk-oxymercuration also occur through this. 

#### Factors Affecting Reactivity 
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
Reactivity &\propto \pi e- density \\
&\propto stability of intermediate cation \\
&\propto presence of EDG \\
&\propto \frac{1}{presence of EWG} \\
 }
\end{split}
$$

Between alkene and alkyne, alkene are more reactive because carbocation formed is more stable.

Here steric hinderance has no effect on the reactivity.

## Reactions 
### Addition of HX
According to mechanism 1 where classical carbocation is formed.

It is non stereoselective and non stereospecific reaction but is a regioselective reaction. 


![[Pasted image 20231025192231.png]]

Enantiomers are formed,
![[Pasted image 20231025192511.png]]

Major product is generally Markovnikoff, but the deciding factor is stability of carbocation.

![[Pasted image 20231025130429.png]]
(no reaction because there is only Nu, $\ce{ X- }$ and it does not react on C-C multiple bond)
($\ce{ Na+ }$ is not an electrophile as 1st and 2nd group elements do not act as electrophile)

##### Example Reactions 
![[Pasted image 20231025130850.png]]

![[Pasted image 20231025190119.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231025191147.png]]

Sometimes instead of stability of carbocation, the major product is formed by stability of products. #important  
In all 3 below the major product is the more stable one.
![[Pasted image 20231025191858.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231025192024.png]]

### Addition of conc. $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$
According to mechanism 1 where classical carbocation is formed. Everything is the same as addition of HX.

![[Pasted image 20231025192815.png]]

If dilute is taken then alc. is formed.
![[Pasted image 20231025192824.png]]


### Addition of Water (Hydration)
According to mechanism 1 where classical carbocation is formed. Everything is the same as addition of HX.

In neutral or basic medium reaction does not occur. It only occurs in acidic medium. 

![[Pasted image 20231025193136.png]]

It is also called acid catalytic hydration.

![[Pasted image 20231025193643.png]]

Alkynes are very less reactive towards this reaction, so ion of mercury is taken as catalyst. Alkynes form aldehyde or ketone. [[03 Tautomerism]]
![[Pasted image 20231025194031.png]]

### Addition of R-OH
It is the same as addition of water.

![[Pasted image 20231025194355.png]]

### Addition of $\ce{ X_{2}/X-X'/HOX }$
It occurs according to mechanism 2. Non-Classical carbocation intermediate is formed and thus no rearrangement is possible. 

Generally the major product is markovnikoff's. 

It is stereoselective as well as stereospecific reaction. It has anti addition. 

The non polar $\ce{ X_{2} }$ bond is made polar on contact with the double bond. 

![[Pasted image 20231025200819.png]]
($\ce{ I_{2} }$ is reversible as vicinal diiodine is unstable)

In case of bromine water, bromohydrin is formed as water which is a nucleophile is present in greater amount than $\ce{ Br- }$. 
![[Pasted image 20231025201342.png]]

Similarly, if alcohol is taken, then brominated ester is formed and so on by taking other Nu. 
![[Pasted image 20231025201656.png]]

If hypohalous acid is used, halohydrin is formed. 
![[Pasted image 20231025201759.png]]

Reaction with alkyne, #important

![[Pasted image 20231025202543.png]]

![[Pasted image 20231027104841.png]]

##### Anti Addition 
It is an anti addition reaction and so we will take care of the stereo chemistry.
![[Pasted image 20231025201047.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231025202804.png]]

Stereospecificity is shown by,

![[Pasted image 20231025203619.png]]

### Reaction with Nitrosyl Halide 
NOCl (*Tyldane reagent*) or NOBr

The addition is according to mechanism 2, in which Non-Classical carbocation is formed.

Here N acts as lp containing electrophile. 

#mechanism 
![[Pasted image 20231027105027.png]]

### Addition of Carbene
#### Carbene 
Carbene is $\ce{ =C\!: }$  
It has incomplete octet, is an electrophile and a Lewis acid. 
##### Types of Carbene 
1. **Singlet Carbene** in which the two e have opposite spin.
   
   ![[Pasted image 20231027105655.png]]
   
   
1. **Triplet Carbene** in which the two e have same spin. It is more stable as it has lesser e-e repulsion. 
   
   ![[Pasted image 20231027105736.png]]


##### Formation of Carbene
During reaction, first always singlet is formed and if the medium is inert, it becomes triplet.

![[Pasted image 20231027110425.png]]
(diazomethane, ketene, simmon's reagent, dichlorocarbene)

Also, when two groups are eliminated from the same position, it is called $\alpha$-elimination. 

#### Reaction 
Cyclic transition state is formed. 

Insertion as well as addition happens in two separate products. Addition product is major. 

#mechanism 
![[Pasted image 20231027111105.png]]

Reaction of triplet carbene is not stereospecific as it forms two bonds in two steps which gives time for rotation. 

##### Example Reactions 
![[Pasted image 20231027111257.png]]

### Oxymercuration - Demercuration
Simiar to this is Alk-oxymercuration - Demercuration. 

Both occur according to mechanism 2.

Oxymercuration is electrophilic addition while demercuration is reduction. 

![[Pasted image 20231027112115.png]]

We can treat this as markovnikoff addition of water without rearrangement.

If R-OH is used then ether is formed.

![[Pasted image 20231027191653.png]]

### Hydroboration
Addition of H and B. 

This occurs neither through mechanism 1 nor 2. 

Addition of H occurs at the C which has more crowding and that of $\ce{ BH_{2} }$ occurs at the C which has less crowding. 

Hydroboration is syn-addition of H and B. (syn-addition means that addition is through same side)

#mechanism 
![[Pasted image 20231027112816.png]]

In the end trialkyl borane is formed. However if alkyl is big then only monoalkyl borane is formed. 

Hydroboration is highly regioselective. 
It is also a stereoselective as well as stereospecific reaction. 

On alkyne, only alkene is formed and another addition of H and B does not happen on C=C.
