# Acid Base Reactions
![[Pasted image 20230916081300.png]]

The condition of reaction is that the reactant side should have stronger acid and base than the product side.

### Acid base Reaction of $\ce{ NaHCO_{3} }$
[[05 Detection of FG#Sodium Bicarbonate Test]]

Acids which are stronger than carbonic acid can give this test. 

### Acid base Reaction of Active H

![[Pasted image 20230916081946.png]]

H becomes active if it is connected to:
- O ($\ce{ H_{2}O, R-OH, Ph-OH, R-COOH, R-SO_{3}H, }$ etc.)
- N ($\ce{ NH_{3}, R-NH_{2}, R_{2}NH, R-CONH_{2}, }$ etc.)
- S ($\ce{ H_{2}S, R-SH }$)
- $\ce{ C#C }$ (i.e. terminal alkyne) 
- X (halogen)
- C which has 2 or more -M groups. This is called **Active Methylene Group.**

We make all the products, and then check if the product acid is stronger. If it is, then the reaction does not occur.

(reaction with $\ce{ Na_{2}CO_{3} }$ is actually possible. See [[03 Phenol#Reaction with Bases]])

Terminal alkyne's H is more acidic than an H connected to $sp^{3}$ N. #important

## Grignard Reagent 
It is an organometallic compound.

#### Formation of RMgX
#mechanism 

Mg is put in excess in alkyl halide solution in ether solvent. 

![[Pasted image 20230916082427.png]]

Ether is used as solvent because it is relatively inert and thus does not react with GR which is a very reactive compound. It also completes octet of Mg. 

![[Pasted image 20230916082540.png]]

However, 3,4 membered cyclic ethers (epoxide and oxirane) cannot be taken as solvent because they are more reactive due to high ring strain and react with GR. 

![[Pasted image 20230916082726.png]]

They give ring opening reaction with GR.

#### Formation of Other Organometallic Compounds

![[Pasted image 20231002120244.png]]
(Gilmann's reagent)

The strongest is $\ce{ RLi }$ and then is $\ce{ RMgX }$. The rest two are comparatively weak and they do not give reaction with aldehyde, ketone or cyanides. 

The strength is judged based on the +ve charge formed on the C

#### Digrignard Reagent 
If adjacent or beta positions have halides, then digrignard reagent is not formed. Either alkene or rings are formed. 

![[Pasted image 20231002123728.png]]

If more C are in between, then digrignard reagent is formed. But it still decomposes to form something else if left for a while.

### Reactivity 
- **wrt X:**
  $$\ce{ R-MgI > R-MgBr > R-MgCl }$$
  
- **wrt R:**
  $$\ce{ R-CH_{2}-MgX > R-CH=CH-MgX > R-C#C-MgX }$$
  
  As nucleophilicity and basicity increases with increase in s character.
