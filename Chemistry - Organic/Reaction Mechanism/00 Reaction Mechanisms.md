# Reaction Mechanisms
#### Bond Fission 
Breaking of bond. 

##### Homolytic Fission 
When the e are divided on both atoms, free radicle is formed. 
   
Its favourable conditions are:
1. Non-polar or very less polar bond.
2. Non polar solvent. 
3. High Temp./$h\nu$
4. Presence of free radicle, peroxide, electricity.

##### Heterolytic Fission
When the e are taken by the more electronegative atom, ions are formed.
   
Its favourable conditions are:
1. High Temp./$h\nu$

Heterolysis takes more energy than homolysis for the same bond.

##### KCP and TCP 
**Kinetic Control Product:** It has lower activation energy. Major at lower temp..  
**Thermodynamic Control Product:** It has higher activation energy.  Major at higher temp..

These terms are used for *parallel reactions,* which are when the same reactant gives two products.

#### Short Trick for Stereospecific Reactions 
Addition and Elimination

When addition, go towards right and when elimination, go towards left.

It is used when two chiral atoms are formed. 
To form fisher structure.

**Anti Reaction of Trans forms Erythreo (TAE)**

For syn reaction, the opposite happens. 
**Syn Reaction of Cis forms Erythreo (CSE)**
**Syn Reaction of Trans forms Thereo (TST)**

#### Some Definitions
**Regioselective:** Reaction in which more than one structural isomeric products are formed in different amounts. Halogenation is RSR. (select one sturcture)
See [[05 Free Radicle Substitution#Major and Minor Products]]

**Stereoselective:** Reaction in which one stereoisomeric products is formed as major product out of other possibilities. (select one stereoisomer)

**Stereospecific:** Such type of stereoselective reaction in which one of the stereoisomeric product forms as major product form a specific stereoisomer of reactant. (different stereoisomers forms different products)
See [[06 Electrophilic Addition#Electrophile has lp]]

**Chemoselective:** Reactions in which reagents react with specific functional groups of reactant in presence of many other functional groups. (select one functional group)

**Pericyclic:** Reactions in which cyclic transition state is formed. 

### Some Other Misc. Reactions
##### Aromatisation by Dehydrogenation 
Heating in presence of Se or Pd eliminates H and forms aromatic ring.

Dehydrogenation only happens when aromatic ring is formed. It is also called Aromatisation. 

Formation of Benzene, naphthalene, anthracene and pyridine.

## Substitution Reaction 
aka **Displacement Reaction**

Depending on the attacking reagent, they are classified as,
#### [[00 Electrophilic Substitution]] ($\ce{ S_{E} }$) 

#### [[05 Free Radicle Substitution]] ($\ce{ S_{FR} }$)

#### [[00 Nucleophilic Substitution]] ($\ce{ S_{N} }$)
They are of  types: 
- $\ce{ S_{N}1 }$ and $\ce{ S_{N}2 }$: [[01 SN1 and SN2 Mechanisms]]
- $\ce{ S_{N}i }$
- $\ce{ S_{N}(NGP) }$
- $\ce{ S_{N}2_{Th} }$: [[04 Nucleophilic Substitution Th]]
- $\ce{ ArS_{N} }$: [[04 ArSN Reactions]]

## Addition Reaction
Depending on type of reagent added they are classified as,
#### [[06 Electrophilic Addition]] ($\ce{ A_{E} }$) 

#### Free Radicle Addition ($\ce{ A_{FR} }$)
In presence of peroxides/sunlight HBr gives anti markonikoff's product as major product on unsymmetrical alkene or alkyne. 

This effect is called Kharasch or Peroxide effect.

Out of all the HX, only HBr gives $\ce{ A_{FR} }$ because only for it both steps of the chain propagation are exothermic.
