# Electrophilic Substitution 
This is characteristic reaction of aromatic compounds, due to $\pi$ e density on aromatic ring. They are also called Aromatic Electrophilic Substitution Reactions  i.e. $\ce{ ArS_{E} }$.

where, $\ce{ E+ }$ is electrophile.

### Mechanism of $\ce{ ArS_{E} }$
#mechanism 

Reaction occurs in two steps. In step 1 aromaticity breaks and in the 2nd it is regained. 

The cation formed when $\ce{ E+ }$ is added is called *Arenium ion or $\sigma$ complex or Wheland's intermediate.*

![[Pasted image 20231005145128.png]]

Generally the first step is the slow step. But for sulphonation and iodination reactions, step 2 is the slow one. 

Generally **Kinetic Isotopic Effect (KIE)** is not applicable for $\ce{ S_{E} }$ reactions. But for sulphonation and iodination it is applicable.
- **Kinetic Isotopic Effect:** Effect on rate/reactivity of reaction in presence of different isotopes. It is generally applicable when C-H bond breaks in RDS. 
  
	If we use C-D instead of C-H, then the activation energy will be higher and the rate of reaction will be slower because C-H bond is weaker than C-D.

### Factors Affecting Reactivity of $\ce{ ArS_{E} }$

$$\ce{ reactivity of S_{E} \propto stability of intermediate (arenium ion) }$$

Thus reactivity increases in presence of EDG (+M, +HC, +I) (called *activating group*) and decrease in presence of EWG (-M, -I) (called *deactivating groups*). 

Reactivity increases with e density on ring of reactant. 

If both activating and deactivating groups are present then reaction will occur according to activating group. 

If all are activating, then the more activating group is given priority over less activating group. Similarly with deactivating, more deactivating is given priority. 

#### Directing Influence
For substituted aromatic compounds, reactivity and suitable attacking positions for incoming electrophile, both depend on the group which is already present on the ring. 

+M groups are o and p directing and -M groups are m directing. 

o, p directing groups are given priority over m directing.

##### Explanation on Basis of Stability of Arenium ion 

If G donates e, i.e. increases stability of +ve charge, we can see that o and p positions will be most stable. If it withdraws e, i.e. decreases the stability of +ve charge, then m position will be more stable. 

![[Pasted image 20231005153218.png]]

##### Factors affecting o, p ratio for o, p directing groups 
1. **Probability:** there are more o positions than p. Thus o:p = 2:1.
2. **Steric Hinderance:** o has more steric hinderance than p. Thus p > o. This is more effective than probability. 
3. **Electronic effect:** some groups increase e density on o or p positions. For example, F decreases e density at o position considerably and thus p product is major. 
4. **H-bonding:** o position might have H bonding and thus will be major. 
5. **Temperature etc.**

For nitration and chlorination on toluene o product is major (by 2-3%) due to probability. #important 

For example,
![[Pasted image 20231005175901.png]]

o:p ratio increasing does not mean that o will become major.
![[Pasted image 20231005180405.png]]

The order to check for position,
1. Activating group > deactivating group 
2. o, p directing > m directing 
3. more activating > less activating 
4. more deactivating > less deactivating (when both are m directing)

$\ce{ ArS_{N} }$ occurs at $\alpha$ position in Naphthalene. #important

##### Examples on Order of Reactivity 

![[Pasted image 20231005153623.png]]
(toluene, m-xylene, mecitylene. cumem)

We have to look for the amount of delocalisation of +ve charge also if resonance is happening.
