#### Friedel Craft Alkylation
*Note:* in FC Alkylation rearrangement is possible in carbo cation intermediate and thus the most stable cation forms major product. 

**Electrophile:** $\ce{ R+ }$

**Reagents:** 
- $\ce{ R-Cl + AlCl_{3} }$, here $\ce{ R-Cl \neq CH_{2}=CH-Cl }$ i.e. which has unstable cation. 
- $\ce{ R-OH + acid }$. Note that $\ce{ HCl, HBr, HI }$ are not used as they react with alcohol. 
- $\ce{ Alkene + acid }$. Here too $\ce{ HCl, HBr, HI }$ are not used.

In FC Alkylation, polyalkylation takes place because alkylated product molecules are more activated (alkyl is activating group) than unreacted molecules of reactants. I.e. substitution happens more than one even if the moles are taken in 1:1 amounts. 

This is a drawback of FC Alkylation.

If the carbocation formed is highly unstable, the reaction will not happen.

4 phenyl on one C is unstable due to steric hinderance. #important

#### Friedel Craft Acylation
**Electrophile:** $\ce{ R-C+=O <-> R-C#O+ }$ *(acylinium ion)*

**Reagents:** 
- $\ce{ R-CO-Cl + AlCl_{3} }$
- $\ce{ R-CO-O-CO-R + AlCl_{3} }$ 
- $\ce{ R-COOH + conc. H_{2}SO_{4} or conc. H_{3}PO_{4} or polyphosphoric acid }$

Here Ketones are formed. And since they are deactivating, polyacylation does not happen.

##### Reactions 
**FC Acylation on Benzene:**

Reaction of Benzene with Benzoyl Chloride forms Benzophenone.

**Intramolecular FC Acylation:**

(formation of naphthalene and anthracene)

If there is tertiary acid halide or acid anhydride, alkylation takes place instead of acylation because the tertiary carbocation is highly stable. #important

(reaction with Succinic anhydride)

#### Limitations of FC Alkylation and Acylation 
1. FC reactions are not possible in presence of highly deactivating groups (m directing) like $\ce{ NO_{2}, NR_{3}+, NH_{3}+, CN, SO_{3}H, CHO, COR, COOH, CX_{3} }$ etc.
   $\ce{ C+ }$ are weak electrophile. 
   
   This is the reason why nitrobenzene is used as solvent in FC reactions. 
   $\\$

2. FC reactions do not occur in presence of highly activating groups like $\ce{ NH_{2}, NHR, NR_{2}, OH }$ etc. 
   This is because lewis acid can form complex with the lp of these which are deactivating.

FC reaction are possible in the presence of following:

#### Gatterman's Koch Formylation 
It is used to form benzaldehyde. It can be said to be a form of FC reaction as the electrophile is $\ce{ H-C=O }$

The limitations of FC reactions also apply here.

#### Gatterman's Formylation 
It is also used to form benzaldehyde. Here HCN in presence of lewis acid is used. 

An imine intermediate is formed which is then hydrolysed. 
![[Pasted image 20231007181009.png]]

Here too the limitations of FC reactions apply.

#### Reaction of Aldehydes 
Reaction with formaldehyde makes benzyl alcohol in acidic medium. 

![[Pasted image 20231007182949.png]]

Here too the limitations of FC reactions apply.
