# Halogenation
Reactivity: $\ce{ F_{2} > Cl_{2} > Br_{2} > I_{2} }$
Also, Iodination is a reversible reaction, so we have to use an oxidising agent to stop the backward reaction. 

**Electrophile:** $\ce{ X+ }$ (halonium ion)

**Reagents:** 
- $\ce{ X_{2} + lewis acid (AlCl_{3}, BF_{3} etc) }$
  we can also use normal acid or oxidising agent with $\ce{ X_{2} }$ instead of lewis acid. 
- $\ce{ Br_{2} + Fe (Br_{2} + FeBr_{3}) }$

##### Reactions 
**Halogenation of Benzene:**

**Formation of Gammaxene:** #important 
If we react bezene with chlorine in presence of sunlight, addition reaction takes place and 6,6,6/ Benzene Hexa Chloride (BHC)/ Gammaxene/ Lindane is formed. It is used in pesticides.

This reaction happens at specific temp. and pressure. 

**Reaction on Toluene:** o isomer is major if Cl is used. If sunlight is present, then monochlorination happens.

**Reaction on Halobenzene:**

**Reaction on Phenol:** in polar solvent tri halo product which is a white ppt is formed because there is ionisation. Some oxidised products are also formed because halogen water is a mild oxidising agent. 

If reaction takes place in non polar solvent and if the temp. is less than 5$^{\circ}$C, o and p products are formed separately. This is because the ionisation is not that much. However, on heating, the tri halo product is formed.

**Reaction on Aniline:** Trisubstituted product is formed even when using non-polar solvent as its reactivity is high. 

To make p product, we first reduce its reactivity with reaction with acid halide. This product formed is called **Acetanilide.** This method works with phenol as well.

On reaction with carboxylic acid substituted aniline or phenol, #important

If a compound has alkene, then addition reaction happens and not substitution as addition is easier because in $\ce{ S_{E} }$ aromaticity is broken and then regained.
