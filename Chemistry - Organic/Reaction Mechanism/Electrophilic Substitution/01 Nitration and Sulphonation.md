# Nitration and Sulphonation 
#### Nitration 
**Electrophile:** $\ce{ NO_{2}+ }$

**Reagents:** 
- $\ce{ conc. HNO_{2} + H_{2}SO_{4} }$
- fuming nitric acid
- $\ce{ N_{2}O_{5} }$
- $\ce{ NO_{2}+(BF_{4}^{-}), NO_{2}+(CF_{3}COO^{-}) }$ etc.

##### Reactions
**Nitration of Benzene:** (the temp. are important)
![[Pasted image 20231005191603.png]]
(60 for one nitro, 100 for 2 and 150 for 3)

**Formation of Picric acid:**

Other products are major because Phenol is easy to oxidise as it has more e density on ring. 

To make p product major, we use phenol to form ester which cannot be oxidised easily. Thus we can nitrate it and form major p product. 

**Formation of TNT (Trinitro toluene) and TNG (Trinitro glycerine):**

(TNG is used in dynamite)

On reaction with aniline, m product is obtained in considerable amount, because of formation of **anilinium ion** which is m directing. #important (remember the %ages too)

#### Sulphonation 
**Electrophile:** $\ce{ SO_{3} }$ (it is m directing)

**Reagents:** 
- $\ce{ conc. H_{2}SO_{4} }$
- fuming sulphuric acid (*oleum ($\ce{ H_{2}S_{2}O_{7} }$)*)

##### Reactions 
**Sulphonation of Benzene:** it is reversible because the activation energies are almost the same and the backward reaction is called *Desulphonation.* For desulphonation, we take dil. $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$

If we react benzene sulphonic acid with $\ce{ D+ + D_{2}O + \Delta }$ then hex deuterobenzene is formed.

**Reaction on phenol** at 10-15$^{\circ}$C forms major o isomer due to KCP and at 100-110$^{\circ}$C forms major p isomer due to TCP. [[00 Reaction Mechanisms#KCP and TCP|(KCP & TCP)]]

**Reaction on Aniline:** At room temp. acid base reaction happens. On heating only sulphonation occurs and formation of Sulphanilic acid takes place.
