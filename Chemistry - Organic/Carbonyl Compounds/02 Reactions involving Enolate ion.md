#### Aldol Condensation 
#important 

(aldol = aldehyde(also ketone) + alcohol)

$\alpha$ H containing aldehydes/ketones give $\beta$ hydroxy aldehyde/ketone in presence of base (dil KOH, NaOH, $\ce{ Na_{2}CO_{3}, Ba(OH)2, Ca(OH)2 }$ etc.)
Sometimes it happens in acidic medium also. 

On heating aldol, $\alpha - \beta$ unsaturated aldehyde/ketone is formed. This removal of water is the reason for "condensation".

(crotonaldehyde)

Some acids,

Aldol condensation of Acetone forms some #important compounds,

(Mesityl oxide, Phorone, Mesitylene)

##### Crossed Aldol Condensation 
Aldol condensation between different aldehydes/ketones. 

8 products are formed. x + x, y + y, x + y, y + x and their GIs.

##### Intramolecular Aldol Condensation

Keep [[03 Tautomerism]] in mind.

#### Knoevenagel Reaction 
#named_reaction 

Aldehyde/Ketone is heated with AMG, in presence of weak base (amines), both H of the AMG along with the O is removed and double bond is formed. 

![[Pasted image 20240103173121.png]]

Also, nitro alone can make a AMG group.

(tear gas, chloratone)

#### Reformatsky Reaction 
#named_reaction 

Aldehyde/Ketone are reacted with $\alpha$-halo ester, cyanide or amide, in presence of zinc to form $\beta$-hydroxy ester, cyanide, amide. 

Here, we cannot take Mg instead of Zn as Mg will form grignard reagent which will then react on ester, cyanide, amide.

#### Perkin's Reaction 
#named_reaction 

Reactant: Aromatic aldehydes (Ar-CHO) or vinylic aldehyde ($\ce{ C=C-CHO }$)

Reaction with acid anhydride in presence of salt of carboxylate.

Product formed is Cinnamylic carboxylic acid. 

Reaction is just like aldol.

![[Pasted image 20240104182244.png]]

If anhydride + salt of the same acid is written, then do Perkin's reaction.

![[Pasted image 20240104182623.png]]
(acryaldehyde/acrylane, furfural)

#### Claisen Condensation
#important #named_reaction 

It is reaction of 2 $\alpha$-H containing ester (although if only one of them have $\alpha$-H then also the reaction will occur). It is an SN2Th reaction.  

It occurs in presence of strong base (like $\ce{ EtO-, NH_{2}-, Ph- }$).

Product formed is $\beta$-keto ester.

#### $\alpha$-Halogenation 
In presence of acid or base, aldehydes and ketones give $\alpha$ Halogenated product with $\ce{ X_{2} }$.

![[Pasted image 20240104190741.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240104191305.png]]

In acidic medium, only one $\alpha$ H of $\alpha$ C is replaced by halogen. 
In basic medium, all $\alpha$ H are replaced by halogen. 

In acidic medium, lesser acidic $\alpha$ H is replaced, while in basic medium, more acidic $\alpha$ H is replaced. 

![[Pasted image 20240104191559.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240104191610.png]]

When 3 $\alpha$ H are present on same C of aldehyde/ketone then in basic medium, haloform reaction occurs. 

#### Haloform Reaction 
[[04 Nucleophilic Substitution Th#Haloform Reaction]]

The corner H are replaced because they are more acidic. 

![[Pasted image 20240104192405.png]]

Following FG can also give Haloform reaction with halogen + base. 

Any group which forms the same kind of aldehyde/ketone which give haloform reaction. 

$\ce{ X_{2} + OH- }$ is a mild oxidation agent.

![[Pasted image 20240104193036.png]]

If halogen is Iodine, then it is called **Iodoform test.**
