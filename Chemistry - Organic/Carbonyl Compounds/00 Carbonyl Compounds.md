2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (2,4-DNP) aka *Brady's Reagent* forms 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone which is yellow orange in colour. Thus this is used as a test for aldehyde and ketone. 

Semi-carbazide forms Semi-carbazone

##### Reaction of Ammonia with Formaldehyde 
Urotropin is formed which is an antiseptic and is found in urine. 

Reaction of Urotropin with conc. $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$ forms RDX (Researched and Developed Explosive). 

This has structure similar to $\ce{ P_{4}O_{6} }$.

##### Reaction with sec. amines 
Formation of Enamines. 

$\alpha$ position of the aldehyde should have H for this reaction to take place.
