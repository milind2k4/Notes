#### Cannizzaro Reaction
#named_reaction 

It is a disproportionation reaction of 2 molecules of aldehydes which do not have $\alpha$ H in concentrated base. 

Product formed is primary alcohol and salt of carboxylic acid (since its in basic medium).

#mechanism is nucleophilic addition and then acid base reaction,
![[Pasted image 20240104194642.png]]

This reaction is a 3rd order reaction. 
$$\ce{ Rate \propto [CH_{2}=O]^{2} [OH-] }$$
Since C-H bond is breaking in RDS, kinetic isotopic effect is applicable.

Only the aldehyde is affected,

(glyoxalic acid)

##### Crossed Cannizzaro Reaction 
Since the molecule on which OH attacks first gets oxidised, the aldehyde which is more reactive will get oxidised.

#### Benzil - Benzilic acid Rearrangement 

Reactant is Adjacent Diones, $\ce{ R-CO-CO-R }$
Reagent is base, $\ce{ OH- }$
Product formed is $\alpha$ hydroxyl carboxylic acid salt. 

Here $\alpha$ H can be present. 

#mechanism is similar to intramolecular Cannizzaro reaction.

#### Tishchenko Reaction 
#named_reaction 

Reactants are 2 molecules of aldehyde.
Reagent is $\ce{ Al(OEt)3 }$ (aluminium ethoxide).
Product is ester. 

**Hint:** First do Cannizzaro then esterification of the alcohol and carboxylic acid (after acidification) formed.

#### Benzoin Condensation 

Reactants are 2 molecules of aromatic aldehyde.
Reagent is specific: alcoholic $\ce{ CN- }$
Product is $\alpha$ hydroxy ketone. 

#mechanism (IMPT = intramolecular proton transfer)
![[Pasted image 20240105173324.png]]

Here, the H from C, which is more acidic here, transfers to O making OH which is less acidic. 

The aldehyde on which CN$^{-}$ attacks first makes ketone.

#### Witting Reaction 
#named_reaction 

Aldehyde/Ketone when reacted with Methylene triphenyl phosphene (ylide), then alkene and triphenyl phospoxide ($\ce{ O=PPh_{3} }$) are formed.

#mechanism consists of 4MCTS and the reaction is pericyclic.

#### Nucleophilic Addition on $\alpha-\beta$ unsaturated Carbonyl Compound 

![[Pasted image 20240105182346.png]]

1,2 - Addition happens with strong and smaller nucleophile. 
Like,
$$\ce{ RMgX, RLi, LiAlH_{4}, NaBH_{4}, CN- }$$

1,4 - Addition happens with weak and larger nucleophile. 
Like,
$$\ce{ R_{2}CuLi, R_{2}Cd, CN-, AMG, enamine }$$

Cyanide does 1,2 addition in case of aldehyde and 1,4 addition in case of ketone.
