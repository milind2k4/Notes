#### Arndt - Eistert Synthesis
#named_reaction 

It is useful for increasing a $\ce{ CH_{2} }$ group in chain of carboxylic acid. 

First carboxylic acid is converted to acid halide. This halide is reacted with diazomethane to form ketone as in wolff rearrangement. Then $\ce{ Ag_{2}O }$ is added to form Ketene. This ketene is then hydrolysed to form carboxylic acid.
