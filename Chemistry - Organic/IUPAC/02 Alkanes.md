# Alkanes
Alkanes are those hydrocarbons which have only single C-C bonds. I.e. they are saturated hydrocarbons. 

Take care in counting number of C for main chain. 

### Numbering of Main Chain
1. Number the main chain from that corner which as lowest set of position of substituents. 
2. When position set is same, consider alphabetical order. [[00 Nomenclature#Set of Substituents]]


Following are Considered in Alphabetical Order:
- Iso
- Neo
- Di, Tri, Tetra for complex substituent 

Following are not Considered in Alphabetical Order:
- Sec 
- Tert. 
- Di, Tri, Tetra for simple substituents 
- Bis, Tris, Tetrakis

### Naming
1. Write the name of substituents in alphabetical order with their position. 
1. When more than one same simple substituents are present, then use di, tri, tetra. 
2. When more than one same complex substituents are present, use bis, tris, tetrakis, pentakis etc. and write the name of complex sub. in parenthesis.

### Examples

Last one is 4-Bromo-1-chloro-3-(1-methylethyl)pentane

## Common Names
- **n-alkanes:** unbranched alkanes 
- **Isoalkane:** one methyl on straight chain at 2nd position
- **Neoalkane:** two methyl groups on straight chain at 2nd position

In name of alkane we count total no of C.

Iso and Neo are applicable up to 6 C. except isooctane which is,

It does not follow the rules given above. 
It is an industrial use compound, and is considered a good petrol. I.e. the petrol in which this compound is in high %age is a more efficient petrol. 

#### Alkyl Substituents 
1. **n-alkyl:** remove H from straight chain, primary C
2. **Sec. alkyl:** remove H from secondary C
3. **Tert. alkyl:** remove H from tertiary C
4. **Isoalkyl:** remove H from edge C farthest from the methyl attached
5. **Neoalkyl:** remove H from edge C farthest from the methyl attached
