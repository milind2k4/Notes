# Examples
#### Anhydrides
It is formed when a water is removed from 2 molecules of Carboxylic acids.

It is named by keeping in mind which carboxylic acid were taken in the beginning. 

It could be symmetrical or unsymmetrical. 

If it is symmetric, then the name of the original carboxylic acid is written only once. 

If it is unsymmetrical, then we need to write both in alphabetical order.

In cyclic anhydrides, write the name of the acid from which it would be formed and then replace the acid with "anhydride"

#### Ester
In ester, the group bonded with O will be written in place of "alkyl" and will be written first. Even if the main chain has substituents.

Whatever chain has the C atom of ester will be the main chain no matter what. Even if the group connected with O has a double bond.

When ester is as a substituent, then it could be of 2 types, one when the ester groups is attached to the main chain with the O, and one when it is joined with the C. 
$\ce{ -COOR }$: Alkoxy Carbonyl
$\ce{ -O-CO-R }$: Alkanoyloxy

#### Amides
They are also of 3 types. 

The main chain starts from the C of amide. 

Similarly to amines, the group on N is denoted with N.

#### Aldehydes
If aldehyde is present as substituent, then
- when it is not included in the main chain, then it is called **Formyl**
- when it is included, then it is called **Oxo**

Only Aldehyde can be taken into the main chain when counting if it is at the end of the chain.

#### Amine
Amines are of 3 types, 1 deg, 2 deg and 3 deg. 

Degree is decided by how many groups are attached to the N not the C. 

When naming, the group connected with N in 2 or 3 deg amine is written with an N- first and then the rest like usual.

#### Ethers
Ethers are not considered FG, they are substituents. The general name is alkoxyalkane.

In cyclic, we use epoxy and remove the cyclic prefix.
