# Chain Terminating FG
When chain terminating C containing functional group is present on main chain, then numbering starts from that C of functional group. 

These chain terminating functional groups are,
1. $\ce{ -COOH }$ (carboxylic acid)
2. $\ce{ -CO-O-OC-\ }$ (acid anhydride)
3. $\ce{ -CO-OR }$ (ester) 
4. $\ce{ -CO-X }$ (acid halide) 
5. $\ce{ -CO-NH_{2} }$ (amide) 
7. $\ce{ -CN }$ (cyanide)
6. $\ce{ -CHO }$ (aldehyde)

When chain terminating C containing FG, is directly bonded with ring, then the ring is considered as main chain and these special suffix are used for the FG,
1. $\ce{ -COOH }$ (carboxylic acid)
2. $\ce{ -CO-O-OC-\ }$ (carboxylic anhydride)
3. $\ce{ -CO-OR }$ (carboxylate) 
4. $\ce{ -CO-X }$ (carbonyl halide) 
5. $\ce{ -CO-NH_{2} }$ (carboxyamide) 
7. $\ce{ -CN }$ (carbonitrile)
6. $\ce{ -CHO }$ (carbaldehyde)

When more than 2 same chain terminating C containing FG are directly connected with open chain, then open chain is treated as parent chain and above special suffixes are used for FG.
