# IUPAC Nomenclature
First letter is capital, numbers are separated by commas, number and word by hyphen, there should be no gaps. 

If there is a, e, i, o, u or y, the first letter in primary suffix, then we write alk, if not we write alka. (di, tri are considered in this)

If there is y then we remove the last e.

### Priority Orders
#### Main Chain Selection
1. Max. number of principal functional groups.
2. Max. number of C-C multiple bonds.
3. Max. no of C atoms.
4. Max. number of substituents (those which replace H).
5. Lowest set of position (functional group > C-C multiple bonds > substituents). 
6. Alphabetical order of name of substituents. 

#### Numbering of Main Chain
1. Lowest set of position of functional group.
1. Lowest set of position of C-C multiple bonds. 
1. Lowest set of position of substituents. 
2. Alphabetical order of name of substituents. 

### Sequence for Writing IUPAC Name
$$\ce{ 2^{\circ} prefix + 1^{\circ} prefix + \underset{ (alk) }{ word root } + 1^{\circ} suffix + 2^{\circ} suffix }$$

1. **$\ce{ 2^{\circ} suffix }$:** name of substituents, in alphabetical order, with position. 
   e.g. 2-Bromo 1-Chloro

2. **$\ce{ 1^{\circ} prefix }$:** used for cyclic compounds. 
   e.g. cyclo, bicyclo, tricyclo, spiro, bispiro

3. **Word Root:** indicated the number of C atoms in main chain. 
   e.g. 1 - meth, 2 - eth, 3 - prop, 4 - but, 5 - pent, 11 - undec, 12 - dodec, 13 - tridec, 14 - tetradec, 20 - icosa 

4. **$\ce{ 1^{\circ} suffix }$:** indicates nature of C-C multiple bonds, with position, except single bonds. 
   e.g. single - ane, double - ene, triple - yne, double and triple - en-yne, diene-triyne 

5. **$\ce{ 2^{\circ} suffix }$:** suffix of functional group.
   e.g. OH - ol, $\ce{ NH_{2} }$ - amine etc.

### Set of Substituents

Compare each element, and whichever is smaller, chose that one. Here, we compare 2, 2, then 2, 3 and thus chose first numbering.
