# Aromatic
Aromatic compounds have been studied for a really long time and thus, the old names of some compounds have been accepted into the IUPAC system. 

Benzene is not considered the main chain when,
- there are 6 or more C in side chain
- the side chain has double or triple bonds
- there are functional group in the side chain
- there is a substituent in the side chain
it is considered substituent in the above all cases and **Phenyl** is prefix is used. 

### Functional Group on Aromatic
The common named of these compounds have been accepted as IUPAC names. (except p-amino phenol and 2-ethanoyloxybenzoic acid which is **Aspirin**)

### Examples

Benzene is Benzene and 2 Benzene Connected Aromatically is **Naphthalene**, 3 are **Anthracene** 3 but not in a straight line is **Phenanthrene.**

#### With Substituents
The common name of Methylbenzene is **Toluene** and is accepted by IUPAC. Similarly, common name of Methoxybenzene is **Anisole** and is accepted by IUPAC.

Common name of benzene with 2 methyl is called **Xylene** and could be of 3 types,

#### With FG
Any phenol with single methyl substituent is called **Cresol**

Any benzoic acid with single methyl substituent is called **Toluic Acid**

Benzene with 2 -COOH is **Phthalic Acid.**

Benzoic acid with OH group is **Salicylic Acid.**
Benzoic acid with CHO group is **Salicylaldehyde**

Phenol with 3 nitro is called **Picric Acid.**
