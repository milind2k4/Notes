### Metal Catalytic Hydrogenation 
[[01 Hydrogenation]], [[03 Application of e Effects#Heat of Hydrogenation]]

In presence of these metal catalysts partial hydrogenation of alkyne does not take place.

##### Mechanism 
#mechanism 

It occurs at metal surface. 

![[Pasted image 20231027204516.png]]

Metal Catalytic hydrogenation is stereospecific syn addition reaction. 

Since metal is solid and hydrogen is gas, it is heterogeneous hydrogenation. But in presence of **Willkinson's Catalyst ($\ce{ [Rh(PPh)_{3}Cl] }$),** homogeneous hydrogenation takes place.

##### Reactivity 
$$\ce{ \text{reactivity} \propto \frac{ 1 }{ \text{steric hinderance on alkene} } }$$
This is the reason why alkyne is more reactive than alkene.

#### Partial Hydrogenation 
aka *Hydrogenation in presence of poison metal catalyst.*
(poison for reaction)

In presence of poison metal catalyst, hydrogenation takes place of alkyne and acid halide to form cis alkene and aldehyde respectively. 

Lindlar's Catalyst is $\ce{ Pd + CaCO_{3} + solvent }$.
Rosenmund's Catalyst is $\ce{ Pd + BaSO_{4} + solvent }$.
P-2 Catalyst is $\ce{ Ni_{2}B }$.

Reduction of acid halide with Rosenmund's Catalyst is called **Rosenmund's Redction.** #named_reaction

### Reduction with HI + Red P
HI + Red P is a very good reducing agent.

They reduce anything that does not have N to alkane. Those that do contain N are reduced to amine.

### Reduction of Alkyl Halides 
##### With Metal + Acid 
Only primary are reduced.

![[Pasted image 20231030092026.png]]

##### With $\ce{ LiAlH_{4} }$
On tertiary alkyl halide $\ce{ E_{2} }$ elimination happens and alkene is formed. 

![[Pasted image 20231030092559.png]]

##### With $\ce{ NaBH_{4} }$
It only reduces sec. and tert. alkyl halide and does not react with pri. 

![[Pasted image 20231030092703.png]]

##### With $\ce{ Ph_{3}SnH }$ (TTH)
**Triphenyl tin hydride**

It reduces every alkyl halide. On aromatic ring, the reaction is free radicle.

### Reduction with Metal Hydrides 
##### $\ce{ LiAlH_{4} }$ in ether 
It is formed by reaction,
$$\ce{ LiAlH_{3} -> Li[AlH_{4}] }$$

- With nitro group, it reduces aliphatic to amine but aromatic to **azoarene.**

	$\\$

- It does not reduce alkene, but it reduces cinnamyl C-C multiple bond. 
	Cinnamic acid is,
	$$\ce{ Ph-CH=CH-COOH }$$

	Cinnamyl C-C multiple bond is when aromatic ring is connected to double bond which is in turn connected to a -M group. 
	![[Pasted image 20231030093640.png]]
	
	Note that the group as well as the multiple bond is reduced.

- With Azide, epoxide, Lactum (cyclic ester), amide, Lactam (cyclic amide) and imine,

##### DIBAL-H
**Di Iso Butyl Aluminium Hydride**
![[Pasted image 20231030095339.png]]

It gives partial reduction of acid halide, cyanide and ester at very low temp. and converts them into aldehyde. 

At room temp., it forms alcohol or amine.

### Reduction of Nitrobenzene
[[05 Detection of FG#Nitro]]

It occurs in many steps and many products are formed. 

Some of the important products are nitroso benzene, phenyl hydroxy amine, aniline, Azoxy benzene, Azo benzene and hydrazo benzene.

#### Electrolysis of Nitrobenzene 
If it is done in concentrated acid, hydroxyl amine is formed which then rearranges and forms p-amino phenol. #important 

If it is done in dilute acid, aniline is formed.

### Hydroboration
[[06 Electrophilic Addition#Hydroboration]]

Hydroboration can also reduce aldehyde, ketone, carboxylic acid and cyanide. But it does not reduce acid halide. #important
