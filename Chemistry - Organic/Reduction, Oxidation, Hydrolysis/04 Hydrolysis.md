### Hydrolysis of Cyanide and Isocyanide
[[03 Nucleophilic Addition#$ ce{ A_{N} }$ reactions of Cyanide]]

On partial hydrolysis or hydration amide is formed. On complete hydrolysis carboxylic acid is formed. 

Unless indicated otherwise, do complete hydrolysis.


Hydrolysis of isocyanide gives amine and formic acid.

### Hydrolysis of Imine 
When there is C-N double bond, it is called imine. 

On hydrolysis, aldehyde or ketone is formed.

### Hydrolysis of Isocyanate 

Isocyanate is $\ce{ R-N=C=O }$.

### Hydrolysis of Ether
Only occurs in acidic medium.

### Hydrolysis of Acetal and Ketal
Acetal is when two -OR groups and an H is attached on a C. 
Ketal is when two -OR groups and no H is attached on a C. 

Hydrolysis occurs only in acidic medium and it happens like ethers.

Aldehyde and Ketone is formed.

### Hydrolysis of Hemiacetal and Hemiketal

Hemiacetal is when -OR, -OH and an H are attached on a C.           
Hemiketal is when -OR, -OH and no H are attached on a C.  

Hydrolysis can occur in acidic as well as basic medium and occurs just like ethers.
