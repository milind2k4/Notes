### Stephen's Reduction of Cyanide 
**Cyanide** is reduced with $\ce{ SnCl_{2} + HCl or Sn + HCl }$ to give **aldehyde.**

### MPV Reduction of Aldehyde and Ketones
**MPV = Meerwein Ponndorf's Verley**

**Aldehyde or ketone** is reduced with aluminium isopropoxide + isopropyl alcohol to give **alcohol and acetone.** 

This is a reversible reaction and the reverse is called **Oppenoir's Oxidation.**

### Clemmenson's and Wolff-Kishner Reduction of Aldehydes and Ketones
[[00 Reaction Mechanisms#Reduction of Aldehyde and Ketones]]

Aldehydes and ketones are reduced to alkane.

Clemmenson's reduction should be avoided when an acid sensitive group is present. i.e. $\ce{ C=C, C#C, R-OH, R-O-R }$ etc.

Wolff-Kishner reduction should be avoided when a base sensitive group is present. i.e. $\ce{ R-X, RCOX, -COOR, epoxide, -NR_{3}+ }$ etc.

### Birch Reduction 
Reagents are Li/Na/K + $\ce{ (NH_{3})_{(l)} }$. I.e. basic metal + liquid ammonia. 

Non terminal alkyne is reduced to trans alkene. 
Terminal alkene is converted to alkane. 
Benzene is converted to cyclohex-1,4-ene.

##### Mechanism 
#mechanism 
![[Pasted image 20231027220417.png]]
Here anion radicle intermediate is formed. 
Trans alkene is formed because the e orbitals are more stable when trans. 

Terminal alkyne does not undergo reduction because it acid base reacts with Na.
