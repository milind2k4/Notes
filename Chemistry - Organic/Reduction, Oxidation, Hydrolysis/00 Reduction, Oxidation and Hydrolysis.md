# Reduction, Oxidation and Hydrolysis
## [[01 Reduction|Reduction]]
Addition of H/less EN atom, removal of O/more EN atom, addition of e or decrease in ON are all **Reduction.**

### Reduction Steps of Various FG
(do not read on 2nd read)

Alkene reduces to alkane.

Acid derivative reduces to aldehyde. 
Ester reduces to aldehyde + alcohol
Anhydride reduces to carboxylic acid + aldehyde.
Amide reduces to amine. 

Cyanide reduces to imine.

#### Reducing Agents Table
Reaction and then whether the reducing agents do the reaction.

*Bouveault Balc Reduction (BBR)* whose reagent is Na + EtOH.

The ones present here reduce N containing FG to amine and O containing FG to alcohol.

On high temp or specific conditions, $\ce{ H_{2} + metal }$ reduces all. Under normal conditions **acid, ester and amide + anhydride** are not reduced.

$\ce{ LiAlH_{4} }$ cannot reduce **alkene or alkyne.** 

$\ce{ NaBH_{4} }$ only reduces **aldehyde, ketone, acid halide and alkyl halide.** 

BBR does not reduce **acid, amide, alkene and alkyne.** It is mainly used for ester.

## [[02 Oxidation|Oxidation]] 

Oxidation of FG is just the reverse of reduction. The pathway is the reverse of reduction. 
i.e. pri. alcohol -> aldehyde -> carboxylic acid. 

Since oxidation is the removal of e, it occurs where there is more e density on the compound.

##### Oxidising Agents 
**PCC:** Pyridiniumchloro chromate
![[Pasted image 20231031101005.png]]

**PDC:** Pyridinium dichromate.
![[Pasted image 20231031101108.png]]

**Collin's Reagent:** 
$$\ce{ CrO_{3} + CH_{2}Cl_{2} + Py }$$

**Oppenoir Oxidation:** It is the reverse of MPV reduction. 
$$\ce{ Al(-O-t.Bu)3 + Acetone }$$

#### Oxidation Agent Table 
Oxidation of ketones is very difficult.  It occurs under very specific conditions and forms carboxylic acid.

Carboxylic acid is not oxidised, except formic acid which forms carbonic acid ($\ce{ OH-CO-OH }$). Which in turn forms $\ce{ CO_{2} + H_{2}O }$

## [[04 Hydrolysis|Hydrolysis]]

## Some Heating Effects 
Heating of $\beta$-hydroxy or amine with strong -M groups forms $\alpha-\beta$-unsaturated compound.

### Heating of Hydroxy carboxylic acid 
$\alpha$-hydroxy carboxylic acid forms cyclic di ester (lactide).
![[Pasted image 20231109204201.png]]

$\beta$-hydroxy carboxylic acid forms $\alpha-\beta$-unsaturated carboxylic acid by dehydration reaction. 
![[Pasted image 20231109204211.png]]

$\upgamma$-hydroxy carboxylic acid forms cyclic ester ($\upgamma$-lactone) by internal esterification reaction. 
![[Pasted image 20231109204534.png]]

$\delta$-hydroxy carboxylic acid forms cyclic ester ($\delta$-lactone) by internal esterification reaction. 
![[Pasted image 20231109204541.png]]

Higher hydroxy carboxylic acid forms polyester. 
![[Pasted image 20231109204801.png]]

### Heating of Amino Carboxylic Acid 
Reaction is just like hydroxy carboxylic acid.

$\alpha$-amino carboxylic acid forms cyclic di amine.
![[Pasted image 20231109205002.png]]

$\beta$-amino carboxylic acid forms $\alpha-\beta$-unsaturated carboxylic acid by dehydration reaction. 
![[Pasted image 20231109205041.png]]

$\upgamma$-amino carboxylic acid forms cyclic ester ($\upgamma$-lactam) by internal esterification reaction. 
![[Pasted image 20231109205058.png]]

$\delta$-amino carboxylic acid forms cyclic ester ($\delta$-lactam) by internal esterification reaction. 
![[Pasted image 20231109205115.png]]

Higher amino carboxylic acid forms polyamide.
![[Pasted image 20231109205415.png]]

### Heating of Dioic Acids
Heating of oxalic, malonic, succinic, glutaric, adipic and pimalic acid.


Oxalic and Malonic remove one $\ce{ CO_{2} }$ and form carboxylic acid of remaining C.

Succinic and Glutaric remove one molecule of water and form anhydride. 

Adipic and Pimelic remove one $\ce{ CO_{2} + H_{2}O }$ and form ketone. 

![[Pasted image 20231109210018.png]]

Higher dioic acids form polymer. 

### Decarboxylation
**Decarboxylation with soda lime,**
#mechanism 
![[Pasted image 20231228203314.png]]

Rate of decarboxylation is directly proportional to stability of carbanion intermediate ($1^{\circ} > 2^{\circ} > 3^{\circ}$)

Here all the $\ce{ CO_{2} }$ are removed

**Decarboxylation on heating,**
If there is strong -M group at $\beta$ position of carboxylic acid, $\ce{ CO_{2} }$ of carboxylic acid is removed. 

#mechanism of this reaction is cyclic,
![[Pasted image 20231109210621.png]]

Here, since enol is formed, if unstable enol is formed, that reaction will not occur.
