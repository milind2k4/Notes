# Oxidation of Aldehydes and Ketones
#### Oxidation of Aldehydes 
Strong OA oxidise it to carboxylic acid. 
Weak OA do not react.

Tollen's Reagent, $\ce{ AgNO_{3} + NH_{4}OH }$ or $\ce{ [Ag(NH_{3})2]OH }$ oxidises to carboxylic acid and forms silver, which is Silver Mirror Test. 

On heating with Silver Oxide also it gives silver mirror test. 

With Fehling Solution, which is of two types,
1. $\ce{ CuSO_{4} + NaOH }$ in water 
2. Sod. Pot. Tartarate (aka *Rachell's Salt*)

it gives red ppt as it forms copper oxide and oxidises to carboxylic acid. This is Fehling Solution Test.

With Benedict Solution, which is $\ce{ CuSO_{4} + Na_{2}CO_{3} + Sod. Citrate }$, it forms red ppt (Cu$_{2}$O). 

With Schiff's Reagent it forms Schiff's Base which is pink. 

With mercury chloride, it forms white ppt.

Tollen's Reagent, Fehling Solution, Benedict Solution, Schiff's Reagents and Mercuric Chloride are tests for Aldehyde but not for ketones. [[05 Detection of FG#Aldehydes]]

Some compounds which are not aldehydes but give aldehyde test are Formic acid, hemiacetal and $\alpha$-hydroxy ketone. They give Tollen's, Fehling and Benedict Test.

If aldehyde is directly connected to aromatic ring or double bond, it does not give Fehling, Benedict or Shiff's test. #important

#### Oxidation of Ketones 
No Oxidation in normal conditions. 

Oxidation happens under high temp. and pressure. And under those condition too, only  $\alpha$ methylene ketones are oxidised (i.e. adjacent position has at least 2 H).

If oxidised, both sides become carboxylic acid.

If formic acid is formed, then it is oxidised to $\ce{ CO_{2} }$.

(Adipic acid)

If ketone is asymmetric, then the side which has greater number of C is broken off. This is called **Popaff's Rule.**
This is because the bigger the C chain the more is +I effect.

#### With $\ce{ SeO_{2}, \Delta }$
Selenium Dioxide. 

It substitutes two H for an O at the alpha position of ketone.
![[Pasted image 20231107212504.png]]

It forms cyclic transition state and thus the position which has less crowding is major.

#### Baeyer Villiger Oxidation 
#named_reaction 

It is a rearrangement reaction. 

On reaction of Ketone with peroxy acid, one O of peroxy acid goes between R and CO and forms ester.

If ketone is unsymmetrical, then the O goes towards the one groups which has more Migratory Aptitude. The more e density the R groups has, the more migratory aptitude it has.

#mechanism 

It is a rearrangement reaction because the RDS is the one in which R' migrates.
