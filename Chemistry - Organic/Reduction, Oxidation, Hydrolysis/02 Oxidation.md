# Oxidations 
### Oxidation of Alkanes 
n-Alkanes cannot be oxidised. 

Only branched ones get oxidised. Tertiary $\ce{ C-H }$ bond is oxidised to tert. alcohol.

### Oxidation of Alkenes and Alkynes 
Oxidation of alkene or alkyne is difficult.

#### [[03 Ozonolysis|Ozonolysis]] 
#mechanism 

**Alkene,**
![[Pasted image 20231031102132.png]]
(molozonide, ozonide)

**Alkyne,**
![[Pasted image 20231031102827.png]]

**Aromatic Ring,** (only possible at high temp.)
![[Pasted image 20231101214409.png]]

#### With SOA 
The same products as oxidative Ozonolysis are formed. Take care to convert formic acid into $\ce{ CO_{2} + H_{2}O }$.  

#### With Linux Reagents 
Linux reagent is of two types,
1. $\ce{ NaIO_{4} + OsO_{4} }$: Forms same products as reductive ozonolysis.
1. $\ce{ NaIO_{4} + KMnO_{4} }$: Forms same products as oxidative ozonolysis.

$\ce{ NaIO_{4} }$ is called sodium per iodate

#### Epoxidation of Alkenes 
**Reagents:** (the first two do direct, while the last does indirect epoxidation)
- per oxy acid (acid which have peroxide bond)
	![[Pasted image 20231101215527.png]]
	(the abbreviations are #important)
- $\ce{ 2Ag + O_{2} ->[\Delta] Ag_{2}O + [O] }$
- $\ce{ (i) HOBr\ (ii) Base }$

Trans alkene forms trans epoxide and cis forms cis. Thus epoxidation is stereospecific. 

Epoxidation does not happen on aromatic ring. 
##### Mechanisms

#### Hydroxylation 
Addition of hydroxyl groups (-OH)

![[Pasted image 20231102131918.png]]

There are two types of hydroxylation based on stereochemistry,
1. **Syn Hydroxylation,** for which reagents are,
   - $\ce{ cold and dil KMnO_{4}, OH- }$ (Bayer's Reagent)
   - $\ce{ (i) OsO_{4}\ (ii) NaHSO_{3}/H_{2}O_{2} }$
1. **Anti Hydroxylation,** for which we first do epoxidation and then hydrolysis. Also, since alkynes cannot undergo epoxidation, on alkyne anti addition does not happen.

### Oxidation of Alcohols 
Primary and secondary alcohols on oxidation form aldehyde and ketone respectively. 

Tertiary alcohol do not undergo oxidation.

![[Pasted image 20231102133822.png]]
(Oppenoir's  oxidation #named_reaction)

##### With Cu + Heat 
Primary alcohol converts to aldehyde, secondary converts to ketones and tertiary  converts to some alkene. 

![[Pasted image 20231102134202.png]]

##### With $\ce{ MnO_{2} }$ + Heat
It is a weak and selective oxidising agent. It only oxidises allylic and benzylic alcohols and forms aldehyde or ketones. 

![[Pasted image 20231102134632.png]]

##### With Nitric Acid, $\ce{ HNO_{3} }$
It converts primary to carboxylic acid and does not oxidise secondary or tertiary.

![[Pasted image 20231107203150.png]]

##### With Bromine Water
It does not oxidise alcohol, but oxidises aldehyde to carboxylic acid. 

![[Pasted image 20231107203302.png]]

##### With Periodic Acid
Periodic acid is $\ce{ HIO_{4} = H_{5}IO_{6} }$
Also,
$$\ce{ HIO_{4} + H_{2}O -> H_{5}IO_{6} }$$

It gives oxidative dissociation on vicinal dilol, adjacent diones and $\alpha$ hydroxy aldehyde or ketones.

![[Pasted image 20231107203619.png]]

It oxidises alcohol to aldehyde or ketone, aldehyde or ketone to carboxylic acid and carboxylic to $\ce{ CO_{2} }$. 

![[Pasted image 20231107204323.png]]

It does step by step oxidation. I.e. the more bonds break, the more oxidation occurs. 

![[Pasted image 20231107204333.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231107204628.png]]

Note that cyclic trans diol do not react with periodic acid.
This is because cyclic intermediate is not formed.

### [[03 Oxidation of Ald. & Ketones]]

### Oxidation of Aromatic Compounds
Aromatic compounds don't react with $\ce{ KMnO_{4} }$, but they do react with Vanadium Pentaoxide ($\ce{ V_{2}O_{5} }$) and form alchol or anhydride on heating.

![[Pasted image 20231109193215.png]]
(Maleic anhydride and Pthalic Anhydride)

#### Oxidation of Side Chain of Aromatic Ring
If side chain has H or double bond, oxidation with $\ce{ KMnO_{4} }$ forms benzoic acid. 

![[Pasted image 20231109193800.png]]

If there are no H, then there is no reaction.

#### Partial Oxidation of Toluene
#important 


Toluene is reacted with Chromyl Chloride and it forms Aldehyde. 
This reaction is called **Etard Reaction.** #named_reaction
