# Umbrella Inversion
When N, C or O have 3 different groups with a lone pair they can undergo umbrella inversion which results in them being optically inactive at room temp.

At room temp, these compounds (or ions) form racemic mixture.

In umbrella inversion, the smaller lobe of the  $sp^{3}$ hybrid orbital containing lp gains e density and becomes big, making the previously big lobe the smaller one.

Both are equally stable and thus 50% of the mix is inverted and the rest 50% is not. This forms a 100% racemic mix, rendering the solution optically inactive. 

There is however an energy barrier, which it crosses at room temp. and thus can convert to its inverse form. 
If the temperature is very low, the barrier is not crossed and thus both the compounds and thus their respective mixes are optically active.

In As, S etc. (3rd, 4th, 5th period elements) the energy barrier is high and thus there is no interconversion at room temp..

It is also not possible at room temp. when asymmetric N containing lp is present in small ring due to ring strain. When inversion happens, there is a planar state, which cannot be obtained at low temp. in small rings.
