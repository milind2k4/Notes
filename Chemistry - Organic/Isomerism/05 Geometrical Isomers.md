# Geometrical Isomers 
Stereo isomers which are not interconvertible due  to pressure of restricted rotation. 

They have different distance between two particular groups/atoms.

If same groups are on the same side, then the compound is called **cis-** and if they are opposite sides then they are called **trans-**. Thus GI is also called *cis-trans isomerism.*

In N containing compounds in place of cis and trans notation, we use syn or anti are used.

If there are two compounds which are stereo isomers and have different distanced in different isomers, then they are geometrical isomers. 

Thus, Linear, Trigonal Planar and Tetrahedral cannot show GI.

Trigonal bipyramidal  and Square Planar can show GI.

#### Conditions of GI in Organic Compounds
1. Compound should contain a double bond (C=C, C=N, N=N double bonds) or substituted ring.
2. Both C atoms of geometrical centres should have 2-2 different groups.

Examples which can and cannot show GI,

#### GI in $\ce{ C=C }$ containing Compounds 
Structure,
![[Pasted image 20230719202846.png]]

Condition for GI: 
- $\ce{ xyC=Cxy }$, $x \neq y$
- $\ce{ xyC=Cab }$, $x \neq y$ and $a \neq b$

Thus, $\ce{ xyC=Caa }$ cannot show GI,
![[Pasted image 20230719203057.png]]

Examples,

Stilbene,

Cinnamic Acid, Butenedioic acid (maleic acid, fumaric acid), 
![[Pasted image 20230719203804.png]]

In some compounds where the two groups are not the same, we do not use cis or trans notation, so here cis and trans is not used.

#### GI in $\ce{ C=N }$ Containing Compounds 
Structure,
![[Pasted image 20230719203956.png]]

Condition for GI:
- $\ce{ xyC=N-G }$, $x \neq y$

Formation of $\ce{ C=N }$,
![[Pasted image 20230719204149.png]]

Reaction of Ketone and various hydrazines or amines forms various important compounds,
![[Pasted image 20230719204504.png]]
(Imine (Schiff's base), aldoxime, ketoxime, hydrazone, phenyl hydrazone, 2,4-DNP hydrazone)

When asymmetric carbonyl compounds ($\ce{ R'-CO-R }$) react with $\ce{ NH_{2}-G }$, then more than one geometrical isomeric products are formed. 
![[Pasted image 20230719204953.png]]

In oximes, Syn is when OH and H are on the same side and Anti is when H and OH on opposite sides.

For example,

#### GI in $\ce{ N=N }$ Containing Compounds 
Structure:
![[Pasted image 20230719205629.png]]

Condition for GI: 
- None, always shows GI.

Here, Syn is when lp lp are on the same side and anti is when lp lp are on opposite sides. 

#### GI in substituted cyclic compounds 
Structure:
![[Pasted image 20230726210253.png]]

Condition for GI:
- Any two $sp^{3}$ C of the ring should contain 2-2 different groups.

#### GI in Cycloalkene due to C=C of ring
In small cycloalkenes (up to 7 C), only the cis form exists in nature. The trans form does not exist as it is unstable due to ring strain. 

![[Pasted image 20230726213405.png]]

Rings bigger than or equal to 8 C show GI.

![[Pasted image 20230726213450.png]]

The trans form is less stable than cis form due to ring strain until 11 C rings. Rings with 12 or more C have more stable trans isomer. 
![[Pasted image 20230726213956.png]]

#### GI in Cumulenes 
Cumulated dienes have the two double bonds in perpendicular planes. 
![[Pasted image 20230726214620.png]]

Cumulenes cannot show GI because the relative distance does not change on changing positions.
![[Pasted image 20230726214805.png]]

If there are 3 cumulated double bonds, the compounds can again show GI. 
4 cumulated double bonds again cannot show GI. 


Thus for cumulenes,
- Terminal groups should be different
- Odd number of cumulated double bonds.

#### GI in Spiro Compounds 
Spiro compounds is when two rings are connected via one C. 

Two rings of a Spiro compound are always in different planes. 

Similar to cumulenes, spiro compounds with even number of rings cannot show GI. 
Spiro compounds with odd number of rings can show GI. 

![[Pasted image 20230726215503.png]]

Thus in spiro compounds for GI,
- Groups should be different 
- Odd number of spiro rings

In questions having double bond connected with ring, consider the ring as a double bond and  solve the question on the basis of cumulenes,
![[Pasted image 20230726215820.png]]

#### GI in bicyclic Compounds 
At least 5 atoms in both the rings.

## Calculation of Number of GI
Similar ends means that naming from both ends will be the same. (i.e. completely symmetric compound)

Dissimilar ends means that the naming from both ends will not be the same. (i.e. there is no complete symmetry)

If there are more than 2 substituents on ring, then the formula is not applicable. 
It is also not applicable for branched chains. 
![[Pasted image 20230808212743.png]]

#### For Dissimilar Ends
$$\text{Number of GI} = 2^{n}$$
where n is the number of geometrical centres. 

![[Pasted image 20230808193728.png]]

#### For Similar Ends
If n is odd,
$$\text{Number of GI} = 2^{n-1} + 2^{(n-1)/2}$$
(n is odd so subtract 1, which is odd)

If n is even,
$$\text{Number of GI} = 2^{n-1} + 2^{(n-2)/2}$$
(n is even so subtract 2, which is even)
