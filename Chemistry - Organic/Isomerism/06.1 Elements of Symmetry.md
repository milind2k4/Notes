# Elements of Symmetry 
If a molecule has more than one chiral C and similar ends, then only we check for elements of symmetry.

**Asymmetric Compounds** are those compounds which have no element of symmetry (AoS, PoS, CoS, AAoS).

**Dissymmetric Compounds** are those which have no PoS, CoS or AAoS.

Both are optically active.


##### Axis of Symmetry $(c)$
This has nothing to do which checking for optical inactivity. 

It is an imaginary axis which passes through a molecule, when we rotate this molecule around this by 360$^{\circ}$, then we obtain identical arrangement (more than one time) wrt original arrangement. 

Every compound has infinite $c_{1}$ axes.

Linear molecules (like HCl) have one $c_{\infty}$ axis,

##### Plane of Symmetry 
It is an imaginary plane which bisects the molecule into two equal parts and these halves are mirror images of each other.

All planar molecules have at least one Plane of Symmetry (plane of molecule). Thus all planar molecules are achiral. #important 

Here, 20 is a chiral compound.

##### Centre of Symmetry 
aka *Point of Symmetry* and *Inversion Centre* 

It is an imaginary point at the centre of molecule from which if a line is drawn in the direction of any particular group and if it is extended in the opposite direction, meets the mirror image of group at equal distance from centre of molecule. 

There can be either one or zero CoS. Odd membered rings cannot have CoS.

It is not necessarily the centre of a symmetric molecule.

From 21 and 30, we see that presence or absence of chiral atoms is not necessary for optical activity.
