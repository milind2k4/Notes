# Isomerism
Isomers are different compounds with same molecular formula. They have different physical/chemical properties.

To check isomers, check number of different elements (except H) and degree of unsaturation. If they are same then the compounds are isomers of each other.  

There are two types of isomers,
1. [[01 Str. Isomerism|Structural Isomers]] (Constitutional isomers)
	1. Chain isomer
	2. Position isomer
	3. Functional Isomer
	4. Metamers
	5. Ring-chain isomers
	6. Tautomers

1. [[04 Stereo Isomerism|Stereo Isomers]] (3D isomers)
	1. Configurational (non interconvertible, separable)
	      1. Geometrical
	      2. Optical
	2. Conformational (interconvertible, non separable)

General order to check for isomerism,
$$\text{Tautomers > Functional > Metamers > Chain > Position > Stereo }$$
