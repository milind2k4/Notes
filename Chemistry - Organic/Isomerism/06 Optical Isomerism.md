# Optical Isomerism 
**Optical Activity:** Compounds which can rotate the vibrational plane of plane [[06 Polarisation|polarised light]] (PPL). The compounds which show optical activity are called optically active compounds.

Stereo isomers which have different optical activity are called **Optical Isomers.** 

#### Checking Optical Activity
**Plane Polarised Light:** Light wave whose vibrations occur only in a single plane. 

![[Polarizing Light.webp]]

**Polarimeter:** Instrument which measured the rotation of PPL after passing through sample of a compound. We rotate the analyser to find the rotation of plane of light.

##### Possible Observations on Analyzer
1. For Optically Inactive Compound (OIC) there will be no rotation. 
   
2. For Optically Active Compound (OAC):
   1. *Clockwise (+ve) rotation* in which case the compounds are called **dextrorotatory compound** (d or +) 
   1. *Anti-Clockwise (-ve) rotation* in which case the compounds are called **laevorotatory compounds** (l or -)

*Those that rotate the plane clockwise (to the right) are said to be dextrorotatory (from the Latin dexter, "right"). Those that rotate the plane counter clockwise (to the left) are called laevorotatory (from the Latin laevus, "left").*

#### Factors Affecting Value of Observed Rotation 
1. Nature of compound.
3. Concentration of compound in sample tube.
2. Length of sample tube. The longer the tube is, the more molecule there are and thus there is more rotation.
3. Temperature of experiment. 
4. Wavelength of PPL.

#### Specific Rotation $[\alpha]$

$$
\begin{split}
\theta & \propto c.l \\
\theta &= [\alpha] cl
\end{split}
$$
where l is length of tube (dm) and c is concentration (g/ml)

$[\alpha]$ is the constant of proportionality, called Specific Rotation.
$$[\alpha] = \frac{ \theta }{ cl }$$

The value of rotation at $25^{\circ}$C temp, with light of wavelength 582 nm, length of tube 1 decimetre and concentration 1 gram per ml is called **Specific Rotation.**

This specific rotation is constant for a compound.

### Chiral Carbon / Asymmetric Carbon
Four different group/atom containing tetrahedral carbon is called chiral or asymmetric carbon. The C needs to be $sp^{3}$ hybridised. 

Atoms other than C can also be chiral.

![[Pasted image 20230812205702.png]]
(in 13 there are 8 chiral C one just below the top one shown here)

In 16, it looks like the compound has zero chiral atoms but in reality the double bonds on both sides may exist in E, Z form, then it will be chiral but if both are same, the C is not chiral. 

Only one chiral atom containing compounds are always optically active. 

More than one chiral atom containing compound having
1. dissimilar ends is optically active. 
2. similar ends may be optically active or inactive.

#### Examples of Chiral Centres other than C

### Condition of Optical Activity 
Optically active compounds are non super imposable onto their mirror image structure. 

This property of being non super imposable is called **Chirality.** 
Chirality containing compounds are called Chiral Compound. 

Thus all chiral compounds are optically active. 

Chirality (not presence of chiral atom) is the sufficient and necessary condition for optical activity. 

Plane of symmetry or centre of symmetry or alternating axis of symmetry containing compounds are always optically inactive (i.e. they are **achiral**)

Thus in optically active compounds, PoS, CoS or AAoS (Alternating Axis of symmetry) are not present. 

#### [[06.1 Elements of Symmetry]]

### Optically Active Compounds without Chiral Centres 
This is because there is no element of symmetry in these.

#### Cumulenes
When the terminal groups ($x \neq y$) are in different planes, there will be no POS or COS and thus the compound will be optically active.

Thus there should be **even** number of cumulated double bonds and terminal groups should be different.

![[Pasted image 20230825174158.png]]

#### Spiro Compounds 
Similar to cumulenes, if the terminal groups are in different planes and are different, there will be no POS or COS and thus optically active.

Thus there should be **even** number of spiro rings and terminal groups should be different.

#### Ortho Subsumed Biphenyls

In biphenyles, free rotation of the bond between the rings is possible. 

![[Pasted image 20230825175452.png]]

With time rings rotate and thus the extent of resonance decreases, increasing the energy. 

![[Pasted image 20230825175535.png]]

If there are big groups on the o-position of both the rings, there will be repulsion between the groups and thus, no free rotation as the threshold of energy is increased. 

If the groups are bigger than $2.9\ \dot{A}$ (i.e. not $\ce{ H, D, F }$), the rings will be in different planes as, if they are in the plane, there will be repulsion and thus energy will be increased.   

If free rotation is not possible and the groups are different, the compound is optically active.

#### Trans Cycloalkanes 
8 or more C containing rings can be in trans state.
