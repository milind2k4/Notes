# Structural Isomers
Isomers having different structural formula. i.e. different connectivity among atoms. 

#### Chain Isomers
Isomers which have different size of main chain, or side chain.

#### Position Isomers
Isomers which have **same size of main chain and side chain** but have different position of substituents/multiple bonds /functional groups. 

Be careful while deciding if compounds containing [[05.1 Chain Terminating FG|C terminating FG]] are PI or not.

### [[01.5 Functional Isomers]]

### Metamers
**Polyvalent FG:** FG which can divide C chain into two ore more parts e.g. ether, ester, sec. amide etc.
1. Ether: $\ce{ R-O-R }$
1. Thioether: $\ce{ R-S-R }$
1. Sec. Amine: $\ce{ R-NH-R }$
1. Tert. Amine: $\ce{ R-N(-R)-R }$
2. Sec. Amide: $\ce{ R-CO-NH-R }$
2. Tert. Amide: $\ce{ R-CO-N(-R)-R }$
3. Ester: $\ce{ R-CO-OR }$
4. Anhydride: $\ce{ R-CO-O-OC-R }$
5. Sulphonic Ester: $\ce{ R-SO_{2}-OR }$

etc.

Polyvalent functional group containing compounds can show metamerism.

Isomers which have same polyvalent FG but different alkyl substituents (R group is different) are metamers.

We do not consider chain or position isomers. I.e. any change with polyvalent group will be metamers. (eg 3, eg 6)

### Ring-Chain Isomers
Open chain and cyclic isomers are called ring chain isomers. 
They are often functional isomers also. If asked in SQC and both FI and RCI are present in isomers, then FI takes priority.
