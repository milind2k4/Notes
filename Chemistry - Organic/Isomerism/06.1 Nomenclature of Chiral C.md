# Configurational Nomenclature 
of Chiral Centres

1. **Relative** 
	- D, L nomenclature 
	- Threo, Erethio nomenclature 
1. **Absolute** 
	- R, S nomenclature 

They have nothing to do with each other, or the rotation of PPL.

#### D, L nomenclature 
Applicable for [[01 Carbohydrates|carbohydrates]], [[04 Amino Acids|amino acids]] and their derivatives. 

For identification, draw fisher structure in which 1st C of main chain present on top of the vertical line and last C present on bottom of vertical line of fisher formula.

Then compare this with the reference compound.

For carbohydrates, when $\ce{ -OH }$ group of lowest chiral C (in fisher formula) is present on RHS, it is called **D** and if it is on LHS, it is called **L.**

For amino acids, when $\ce{ -NH_{2} }$ group of $\alpha$ position is present on RHS, it is called **D** and if it is on LHS, it is called **L.**

However, note that this D, L configuration is not applicable for compounds with similar ends.

###### Reference Compounds
For Carbohydrates it is **Glyceraldehyde**
For Amino Acids it is **Serine**

###### Examples

Take care to make the configuration of each individual chiral C the same.

#### Threo, Erythro nomenclature 
This notation is applicable for 2 chiral containing C in which at least 2, 2 groups are same on both chiral carbons. 

Fix one of the 2 same groups on the vertical line. 
Now if the other *same groups are on the same side,* the compound is **Erythio** and if they are opposite then they are **Threo.**

### R, S nomenclature 
R is from **Rectus** meaning Right Hand i.e. *clockwise rotation*
S is from **Sinister** meaning Left Hand i.e. *anti-clockwise rotation*

The mirror image of R is S.

For identification of nomenclature of chiral C, give priority order of the four different groups according to [[04 Stereo Isomerism#Chan-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Sequence Rule|CIP sequence rule]].

Then visualise the molecule such that the lowest priority group (4th) is facing away form the observer and the remaining 3 (1,2,3) are facing towards it. 

Now, if the *sequence of 1,2,3 is clockwise,* then the C is **R.** And if it is anti-clockwise, then it is **S.**

##### Short Trick
1. Draw fisher structure of compound 
2. Give priority order of the 4 groups using CIP rule.
3. When 4th group on **vertical line.** 
	1. If rotation of 1,2,3 is clockwise, then it is **R.**
	2. If rotation of 1,2,3 is anti-clockwise, then it is **S.**
3. When 4th group on **horizontal line.** 
	1. If rotation of 1,2,3 is anti-clockwise, then it is **R.**
	2. If rotation of 1,2,3 is  clockwise, then it is **S.**
