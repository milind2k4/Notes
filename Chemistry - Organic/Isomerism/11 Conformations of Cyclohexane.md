# Conformations of Cyclohexane 
[[02.5 Some other e Effects#Baeyer's Angle Strain/Ring Strain]]

Cyclohexane is actually non planar due to ring strain. 

It exist as chair like conformation. There chair conformations are interconvertible at room temp.. 

During flipping (interconversion) of chair conformations, other conformations are also formed,
1. Boat 
2. Twist Boat 
3. Half Chair 

## Chair Conformation

$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
C_{1}-C_{2} &\parallel C_{5}-C_{4} \\
C_{2}-C_{3} &\parallel C_{6}-C_{5} \\
C_{3}-C_{4} &\parallel C_{1}-C_{6}
 }
\end{split}
$$

There is no angle strain nor torsional strain as it is staggered conformation.

Seeing it from the side, 
![[Pasted image 20230914174350.png]]

There are 6 axial positions and 6 equatorial. Alternate axial positions are closer so they feel more steric repulsion. 
Thus big groups do not go to alternate axial positions. They go to either equatorial positions or if that is not possible, adjacent axial positions.

#### Symmetries 

There are 3 POS and COS exists. Thus chair conformation is achiral.

#### cis trans positions 

The ones above the plane will be trans to a position below the plane and vice versa.

### Other Conformations 
Order of stability:
$$\text{Chair > Twist Boat > Boat > Half Chair}$$

#### Boat 
There are two axial positions which are closer to each other than any two other groups. They are called **flag pole** positions.

There is no angle strain but there is high torsional strain as it is eclipsed conformation. 

There are two POS but COS does not exist.

#### Half Chair 
High ring and torsional strain. 

5 molecules are in the same plane. 

There is one POS.

#### Twist Boat 
Partial angle and ring strain. 

There is no POS or COS and it is thus chiral.

### Flipping of Chair Conformation 

During flipping the axial and equatorial positions get interchanged. 

![[Pasted image 20230914174941.png]]

Due to this some flipped configurations are less or more stable than others,

#### Energy Level Diagram 

The energy barrier is 45 kJ/mol.

## Derivatives of Cyclohexane

Generally the groups are on equatorial positions, or alternate equatorial and axial positions.

Some cis conformations are more stable because of H bonding. 
![[Pasted image 20230914180003.png]]

In cyclohexane-1,4-diol, the boat conformation is most stable due to intramolecular H bonding.
