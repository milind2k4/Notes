# Tautomerism
aka Desmotropism, Cryptomerism 

Such type of structural isomers which are interconvertible into each other by changing of position of H (sometimes there's other atoms too) are called **Tautomers.** These tautomers exist in equilibrium state in suitable conditions. 

The phenomenon of interconversion is **Tautomerism.**

Tautomerism happens in gas phase (very slowly) liquid state or aqueous solution. It does not happen in solid state. Interconversion happens very quickly in slightly acidic or basic medium.

If functional isomers are formed by change of position of H, then they are called tautomers not functional isomers.

Tautomers are of two types:
1. Open Chain
	- Diad system
	- Triad system
	- Conjugated system
2. Ring Chain 

### Open Chain Tautomers 
#### Diad System 
When H shifts from 1st position to 2nd position and vice versa. 

Hydrogen Cyanide and Hydrogen Isocyanide is an example of this.

It forms an intermediate $\ce{ [C#N]- }$ and has mechanism,

However, alkyl cyanide and alkyl isocyanide do not form tautomers.

#### Triad System 
When H shifts between 1st and 3rd. 

If there is H on an $sp^{3}$ C next to a polar multiple bond (polarity towards the double bonded atom), then it can go from C to the multiple bonded EN atom. The multiple bond needs to be polar otherwise the relatively strong C-H bond does not break.

If there is H on $sp^{3}$ N/O next to a multiple bond, then H  goes from N/O to multiple bonded atom. Here multiple bond can be either polar or non polar as H bonded N and O are acidic and thus are removed easily.

##### Keto-Enol 
The H that can be moved are called **Enolisable.**

##### Nitro-Acenitro

##### Lactum-Lactim 
Cyclic Amide is called **Lactum.**
Cyclic Ester is called **Lactone.**

#### Conjugated System
If there is H on $sp^{3}$ C/N/O next to a partially +ve C due to resonance, then there will be tautomerism and the H will shift to the O/N of the group causing resonance.

### Mechanism of Keto-Enol Tautomerism 
In Basic Medium the acidic H which is next to CO is removed by the $\ce{ OH- }$ ion from the base. This forms an intermediate which does resonance. The final product is formed depending upon where the H reattaches. 
![[Pasted image 20230715203016.png]]

In acidic Medium the $\ce{ H+ }$ from acid attaches to the O of carbonyl group and forms alcohol. Now the extra H, depending on to which atom it gives its e density, forms different compounds. 
![[Pasted image 20230715203027.png]]

Generally, keto forms are thermodynamically more stable than enol form. And thus %age of keto form is more.

#### Deuterium Exchange
In presence of $\ce{ OD- + D_{2}O }$ or $\ce{ D+ + D_{2}O }$ all enolisable H are replaced by D. This is called **Deuterium Exchange.**

![[Pasted image 20230715203522.png]]

##### Mechanism 
It is the same in both acidic and basic medium. 

The $\ce{ OD- }$ form the base removes an H from the $\alpha$ position in the form of $\ce{ HOD }$, which is lost in the solvent. Then the D from $\ce{ D_{2}O }$ attaches with the $\ce{ O- }$ to form enol form, and with $\ce{ -CH^{-} }$ to form keto form, $\ce{ -CDH- }$. Now when this molecule again undergoes enolisation, the H bond which is weaker is broken and thus another H is replaced by D.

#### Examples
In "explain" questions, make the -ve ion by removing $\alpha$ H and then make the resonating structures. Now add H to each place with -ve charge. 

![[Pasted image 20230715204649.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230715205632.png]]


Similarly with D exchange, everywhere there is -ve charge will have all of its H replaced by D.

### % Enol Content in Keto-Enol Equilibrium 
Generally, % of Keto form $\gg$ % Enol form.
Because of stability.

% of Enol form $\propto$ stability of enol form (resonance, aromatisation, H-bonding etc.)
% of Enol form $\propto$ acidic strength of enolisable H 
% of Enol form $\propto$ $\displaystyle \frac{ 1 }{ \text{polarity of solvent} }$ (because keto forms are more polar)

#### General order of Enol Content 
![[Pasted image 20230715211241.png]]

##### Explanation 
For phenol,
![[Pasted image 20230715211301.png]]

In acetyl acetone, the middle 2 H are very acidic because the anion is resonance stabilised and thus enol content is high. There is also intramolecular H bonding. 
![[Pasted image 20230715211314.png]]
(AMG means [[06 Acidic Strength#Some other Important Orders|active methylene group]])

There is even more conjugation if Ph- group is present. 
![[Pasted image 20230715211649.png]]

In ester, the $\alpha$ H are not sufficiently acidic to be enolised.

In $\beta$-ketoester (here Ethyl Aceto Acetic Ester/Ethy Acetoacetate)
