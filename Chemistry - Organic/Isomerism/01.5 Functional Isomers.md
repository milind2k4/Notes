# Functional Isomers
Isomers having different functional groups. 
We do not consider size of chain or positional isomerism. 

Here we consider any modification which shows it's distinct reaction as functional group. Thus alkanes, alkynes, alkynes are considered functional groups. 

##### Alkane, Alkene, Alkyne

##### Alcohol, Ether, Phenol
Alcohol: when OH is attached with $sp^{3}$ C
Phenol: when OH is attached with aromatic ring
Enol: when OH is attached with double bond, it is generally unstable
