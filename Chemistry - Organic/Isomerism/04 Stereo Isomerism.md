# Stereo Isomerism
Isomers having same structural formula but different stereo formula i.e. different 3D arrangement of atoms/groups.

## Configurational Isomers 
Stereo isomers which are non interconvertible into each other at room temperature without breaking or reformation of bonds.

#### Physical Properties of GI
1. **Boiling Point:** The more is the attraction between the molecules, the more is the boiling point. 
	$$
	\begin{split}
	\ce{ 
	Boiling Point &\propto H-bonding \\
	&\propto Dipole Moment \\
	&\propto Molecular Weight
	 }
	\end{split}
	$$ 
	(more molecular wt. means more Van Der Waal's forces)
	$\\$

2. **Melting Point:** The more symmetric the structure is, the more closely packed the crystal structure is and thus the more is melting point. Generally, trans forms are more symmetrical. 
	$$
	\begin{split}
	\ce{ 
	Melting Point &\propto H-bonding \\
	&\propto Symmetry \\
	&\propto Molecular Weight
	 }
	\end{split}
	$$ 

3. **Solubility in Water:** Since water is polar, the more polar a molecule is the more easily it is soluble. 
   $$
	\begin{split}
	\ce{ 
	Solubility in Water &\propto H-bonding \\
	&\propto Dipole Moment \\
	&\propto \frac{1}{Molecular Weight}
	 }
	\end{split}
	$$ 
	(as molecular wt. increases the molecule becomes bigger and thus it becomes harder for it to sit between the molecules of water)
	$\\$

4. **Stability:** It is inversely proportional to steric hinderance. It is also inversely proportional to Heat of Combustion or Heat of Hydrogenation.

(bp is due to inter and intra molecular H-bonding)

### Calculation of no. of Stereoisomers
Use these when there are any chiral centres. Use the [[05 Geometrical Isomers#Calculation of Number of GI|GI formula]] if there are only geometrical centres and no chiral centres.

n is the number of stereo genic centres (which can show both GI and OI)

n = chiral centres + geometrical centres


| Compound        | n                                   | Stereoisomers           | Optically Inactive |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| Dissimilar Ends | -                                   | $2^{n}$                 | zero               |
| Similar Ends    | Even                                | $2^{n-1}$               | $2^{(n-2)/2}$      |
| Similar Ends    | Odd (with pseudo chiral centres)    | $2^{n-1} - 2^{(n-1)/2}$ | $2^{(n-1)/2}$      |
| Similar Ends    | Odd (without pseudo chiral centres) | $2^{n-1}$               | $2^{(n-1)/2}$      |
