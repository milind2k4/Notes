# 3D Representation of Molecules 
3D projected formula 

**Note:** We get identical configuration of chiral C by even no. of simultaneous group changes on same C. We get different configuration of C if we do odd number of changes.

#### Wedge Dash Projection
Dark wedge represents bond towards the observer, and Dashed wedge is away from it. 

We can make many structures by observing from different positions. Generally however, two bonds are taken in the same plane of C.

#### Fischer Projection Formula 
The $sp^{3}$ C is represented as +. The horizontal line is towards the observer and vertical line is away from it.

1. We get identical structure (homomers) by 180 rotation of Fischer structure in plane of paper. 
2. We get enantiomeric structure by 90 rotation in plane of paper.

#### Sawhorse Projection formula 
Applicable for min. 2 chiral $sp^{3}$ C.

#### Newman's Formula
Applicable for min. 2 chiral $sp^{3}$ C. 

The front C is represented by a point, and the back side C is represented by a circle.

### Interconversion of 3D Projections 
#### Wedge Dash <-> Fischer 
##### One Chiral Carbon
The group on dotted line goes to vertical line (either top or below). 
Then arrange the remaining group in sequence (any sequence).
I.e. if you take the sequence in clockwise order, then put them back in clockwise order.

##### For two Chiral Carbon 
Put both groups on dotted line on the vertical line. 
Then put left group on left and right on right.

#### Fisher <-> Sawhorse <-> Newman 
The C which is lower is considered the one in front in Sawhorse and Newman.

The dotted line group is put at the line below. 
Then put left group on left and right on right.

Alternatively, for the below C, put groups in any order you pick them. (i.e. if clockwise, then put them in clockwise order)

For the top C however, put them in reverse order when making S or N from F. (i.e. if picked them in clockwise order, then put them in anti clockwise order). Otherwise, the same sequence.

If configuration of *all chiral C is the same,* then they are **identical.** 
If configuration of *all chiral C is different,* then they are **enantiomers.** 
If configuration of *not all chiral C is different,* then they are **diastereomers.**

Thus we check configuration for each individual carbon.
We can also check on the basis of sequence of rotation.
