# Configurational Nomenclature 
of Geometric Isomers 

It is of two types:
1. Relative Configuration 
	1. **cis-trans**
	2. **syn-anti** in aldoxime & $\ce{ N=N }$.
2. Absolute Configuration
	- **E-Z** nomenclature

While writing IUPAC name, cis > trans and Z > E and we write conifguration in brackets before the name.

#### Absolute Configuration 
E = Entagen meaning *Opposite* i.e. senior groups opposite side.
Z = Zusammen meaning *Together* i.e. senior groups same side.

(remember that E i.e. Entagen sounds like *anti* and thus means opposite)

Give priority order (1,2) of two groups of same atom of geometrical centre on each side according to CIP sequence rule. Then give E or Z configuration.

##### Chan-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Sequence Rule
1. Give priority to a group which has higher atomic number of first atom.

2. When first atoms are the same between the groups, compare atomic number of second atom (and so on). If there are multiple "2nd atoms" then select the one which has highest atomic number among them. Do not move to the 3rd atom unless all the 2nd atoms are the same.

3. When different isotopes of an elements are present at same position in different groups, then prefer the heavier isotope containing group and chose it to be senior.

4. Between bond pairs and lone pairs, bond pair is senior.

5. When multiple bond is present in a group, then draw an imaginary equivalent structure according to following and then give priority order.
   
   Write the $\sigma$ bonds only and remove the $\pi$ bonds. Then imagine the $\pi$ bonds as $\sigma$ bonds which are connected to an imaginary atom which is the same as the one they were connected to before. 
   
   If the skeletons are the same, then the actual structure is given priority.
