# Conformational Analysis

**Conformation:** Different 3D arrangement of atoms of groups of a molecules which are interconvertible into each other by rotation of $\sigma$ bond at room temp.. 

The stable conformations are called **Conformational Isomers.**
They are also called *Rotomers or Conformers.* 

These conformational isomers are non isolable and thus are not true isomers. 

Conformations are not possible in solid state. 

**Dihedral Angle:** The angle between two group/atoms which are bonded with two adjacent atoms.

### Various Conformations 
1. **Staggered Conformation:** When value of dihedral angle is 60,180,300. 

1. **Eclipsed Conformation:** The conformation in which the value of dihedral angle is 0, 120, 240. 

1. **Skew Conformation:** All conformations other than staggered and eclipsed.

Fisher representation can only represent eclipsed conformations. 

### Factors Affecting Stability of Conformations 
1. **Torsional Strain:** There is repulsion between the bond e of dihedral bonds due to which there is increase in potential energy. 
   
   Thus generally, staggered conformation is more stable than eclipsed. 
   $\\$

2. **Vander Waal's Strain:** Repulsion between groups/atoms which are present on dihedral bonds. Simply steric hinderance.
   $\\$

3. **Hydrogen Bonding:** Intramolecular H bonding containing staggered conformations are generally most stable conformations.

### Energy Barrier
The min. energy required for a complete rotation of a bond. 
$$or$$
The energy difference between the most stable and least stable conformation. 

If this energy is 100 kJ/mol or less, then it will rotate at room temp.

It increases in the presence of bulky groups and multiple bond character.

## Conformations of Various Compounds 
### Ethane 
It has 50 billion rotations per second. 

The staggered are more stable than eclipsed. 
There are thus 3 conformational isomers.

#### Energy Level Diagram 

The energy barrier is 12 kJ/mol.

### Butane 

We make Newman structure using the two C which have the most group variety. 

The most stable are Anti periplanar, then gauche, then partial eclipsed and then completely eclipsed.

#### Energy Level Diagram 

The energy barrier is 19 kJ/mol.

### Stable Conformation 

Generally Anti is the most stable. 

Some compounds are actually polar even if the most stable conformation is non polar.

Some gauche conformations are most stable due to H bonding.

Some compounds have different conformations in different media,

Sometimes instead of H bonding, there is e attraction,
