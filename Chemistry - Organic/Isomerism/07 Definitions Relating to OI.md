# Definitions
### Enantiomers
Stereoisomers which are mirror images of each other but they are not superimposable ono each other. (i.e. the two forms of stereoisomers)

They are always optically active. 

They have identical physical properties except the direction of rotation of plane of PPL. They rotate it by equal magnitudes in opposite directions. 

*They have identical chemical properties with optically inactive reagent, put they have different chemical properties with optically active reagent.* 

They have different biological properties in biological systems. This is because the medium is optically active. Thus D-Glucose will be absorbed into the body, but L-Glucose will not be. The taste and smell might also be different because the sensation of taste or smell is a bio chemical process. 

They cannot be separated by normal physical separation like fractional distillation, recrystallisation etc. This is because these work on different physical properties.

### Diastereomers 
Stereoisomers which are not mirror images of each other. 

This is just a relation between compounds. Thus they may or may not be optically active . 

They have different physical properties and thus they can be separated by normal physical means. 

They may or may not have same chemical properties .

GIs are diastereomers.

### Meso Compounds 
Chiral atom containing optically inactive compound.

Compounds having multiple chiral C with similar ends may or may not be meso. 

They are optically inactive due to internal compensation. 

**Internal Compensation:** is when two chiral C cancel the rotation of PPL.

They have PoS or CoS.

### Racemic Mixture / Modification (d,l) or (+,-)
Mixture of enantiomers.

Mixture of equal amounts of enantiomers is called **100% racemic mixture** and it is optically inactive. This is due to external compensation. 

**External Compensation:** is when d and l enantiomers cancel the rotation of PPL.

The % of racemic mixture is the % of mix which is optically inactive.

#### Enantiomeric Excess
When unequal amount of enantiomers are present in a mixture, then this mixture is optically active. 

The excess % of dominant enantiomer is called *Enantiomeric Excess.* 

$$ee = \frac{ |d- l| }{ d+ l } \times 100$$
where d and l are amount of isomer.

That is, if there is (60 + 40)% d + l mixture, then enantiomeric excess is 20%. 

If there is 100% racemic mixture, then ee = 0. 

$$\ce{ optical purity = \frac{ [\alpha]_{mix} }{ [\alpha]_{pure} } } \times 100$$
Thus giving,
$$\ce{ [\alpha]_{mix} = \frac{optical purity}{100} \times [\alpha]_{pure} }$$

For a racemic mixture,
$$ee = \text{optical purity}$$

Also,
$$\ce{ \% racemic mix = 100 - ee }$$

### Resolution
Since enantiomers cannot be separated from a racemic mixture by normal physical methods, they are separated by special methods. 

Separation method of enantiomers from a racemic mix is called **Resolution.**

Enantiomers are called **resolvable compounds.**

There are 4 types of resolution,
1. Mechanical
2. Biological 
3. Chromatographic
4. Chemical or Diastereomeric

#### Diastereomeric Resolution 
In this method, racemic mix is treated with a pure optically active compound. It forms a mix of diastereomeric products. These can be isolated using physical methods. Finally these isolated diastereomers are used to get back pure enantiomers. 

This ties back into the property of enantiomers to show different compounds on reaction with optically active compound. 

R-R will have mirror image S-S and thus S-R is a different compound with different physical properties.
