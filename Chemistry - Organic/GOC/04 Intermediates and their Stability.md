# Intermediates and their Stability
### Intermediate
The compounds formed between the reactants and products. They may be accompanied by transition states, which have more energy than intermediates.
Transition states cannot be isolated but intermediates can be.

#### Types of Intermediates
1. **Carbocation** (aka Carbonium Ion) which have a vacant orbital, 3 bonds (3 $\sigma$ or 2 $\sigma$ + 1 $\pi$ or 1 $\sigma$ + 2 $\pi$) and 6 e. They are electrophile. Diamagnetic.

   $\\$
2. **Carbanion** which have 3 bonds, a lone pair and 8 e. They are nucleophiles. Diamagnetic.
   
   ![[Pasted image 20230624194917.png]]
   $\\$
3. **Free Radicle** which have 3 bonds, an unpaired e. Paramagnetic. 
   
   ![[Pasted image 20230624195002.png]]
   $\\$
4. **Carbene** which have 2 $\sigma$ bonds and 2 non bonded e which can be paired or unpaired. Incomplete octet. Electrophiles 
   
   They are of two types, 
	- *Singlet*  when the 2 e are paired. Diamagnetic. 
	  ![[Pasted image 20230624195326.png]]
	  $\\$
	  
	- *Triplet* when the 2 e are unpaired. Paramagnetic. 
	  ![[Pasted image 20230624195346.png]]
	  $\\$
1. **Nitrene** when N has one bond and 4 non bonded e. Incomplete octet. Electrophile. 
   
   $\\$
2. **Benzyne** when there is overlapping of the orbitals between two adjacent $sp^{2}$ free radicle which are formed when H is removed. This overlapping is weaker than a $\pi$ bond.
   
   Benzyne is still 6 $\pi$ aromatic intermediate as the 2 free radicles do not take part in resonance.

## Stability of Intermediates
1. When charge is present on different atoms of *same period*, then *stability depends on EN.* Thus stability increases along a group. This takes priority over small resonance.

1. When charge is present on different atoms of *same group*, then *stability depends on size of atom.* Thus stability increases down a group.

2. When charge is present on same atoms in different ions consider various [[02 Electronic Effects]].
	$$
	\begin{split}
	\text{stability of ion} & \propto \frac{ 1 }{ \text{charge density} } \\ \\
	& \propto \text{delocalisation of charge/Resonance}
	\end{split}
	$$ 
	For carbocation and free radicle
	
	$$
	\begin{split}
	\ce{
	stability &\propto presence of EDG (+M, +HC, +I) \\
	stability &\propto \frac{1}{presence of EWG (-M, -I)} \\
	stability &\propto \frac{ 1 }{ \% s character } \\
	}
	\end{split}
	$$  
	 
	For carbanion
	$$
	\begin{split}
	\ce{ 
	stability &\propto presence of EWG (-M, -I) \\
	stability &\propto \frac{1}{presence of EDG (+M, +HC, +I)} \\
	stability &\propto \% s character
	 }
	\end{split}
	$$   

In Aromatic rings,
$$\ce{ HC: o = p }$$
$$\ce{ \pm M: o = p }$$
$$\ce{ \pm I: o > m > p }$$

#### General Order of Stability of Carbocation
Based on Experimental data.

![[Pasted image 20230624202246.png]]
$3^{\circ}$ alkyl cation being more stable than benzyl cation is an exception. 

The last three are unstable and thus does not exist.

##### Exceptional Case of Cyclopropyl methyl cation 
#important 

Cyclopropyl methyl cation is highly stable due to delocalisation of loosely bonded $\sigma$ bond of ring with vacant $p$ orbital of +vely charged C. 

There is no head on $\sigma$ bond between the C atoms in the ring. They have slightly skewed overlapping and thus the bonds are not strong and the compound is not highly stable. The e density is on the side of the ring and thus cyclopropane shows hydrogenation and thus the ring breaks. 

The vacant p orbital of the carbocation overlaps with the loosely bonded $\sigma$ bonds. 

![[Pasted image 20230624204316.png]]
(the C of the rings are $sp^{3}$ hybridised and the other 2 orbitals are making $\sigma$ bond with H)

##### Dancing Resonance
#important 

To explain the bonding in Cyclopropyl methyl carbocation, Dancing resonance is proposed. It is the delocalisation of $\sigma$ bonds. 

This is so strong that +ve charge next to 3 membered rings are more stable than even tropylium ion.

#### General Order of Stability of Carbanions

![[Pasted image 20230624205125.png]]

$sp$ C carbanion being more stable than resonance is an exception. 
Ketone has even more -M than 3 phenyl groups. 

If there are 3 Ketonic groups on carbanion, it is even more stable than the most stable one shown here. 
 
#### General Order of Stability of Free Radicles

Treat them as cations they are e deficient but they don't have +ve charge.

Chlorine has [[08 Hybridisation#Back Bonding]], while Fluorine does not, #important 
Only in F and Cl we consider the -M effect of the vacant d orbital of Cl,
