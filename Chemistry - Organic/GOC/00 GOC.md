# General Organic Chemistry

#### Identifying $\sigma$ and $\pi$
A single bond is $\sigma$, a double bond is $\ce{ 1 \sigma\ \&\ 1 \pi }$ and a triple bond is $\ce{ 1 \sigma\ \&\ 2 \pi }$.

### Conjugated, Cumulated and Isolated Double Bonds

Conjugated is when there is one single bond in between.

Cumulated is when they are next to each other.

Isolated is when there is more than one single bond in between.

### Positions
1. **Allylic:** Adjacent $sp^{3}$ C of $\ce{ C=C }$.
2. **Vinylic:** $sp^{2}$ C of $\ce{ C=C }$.

3. **Propargylic:** Adjacent $sp^{3}$ C of $\ce{ C#C }$.

4. **Benzylic:** Adjacent $sp^{3}$ C of aromatic ring.

## Finding Hybridisation
Number of $\sigma$ bonds + lone pairs = number of hybridised orbitals.
Lone pairs which are resonated are not counted towards hybridisation. 

#### Identifying Hybridisation of C
- 4 $\sigma$ bonds means $sp^{3}$ hybridisation 
- 3 $\sigma$ + 1 $\pi$ bonds means $sp^{2}$ hybridisation 
- 2 $\sigma$ + 2 $\pi$ bonds means $sp$ hybridisation 


## Aromaticity
The compounds which have a smell are called aromatic. However, this definition no longer holds as many aromatic compounds are found which have no smell and many non aromatic which have smell. 

Thus we call a compound aromatic if it follows the conditions for aromaticity.

The ring is aromatic in an aromatic compound. 

In counting $\pi$ e we only count the number of $\pi$ e conjugated in the ring and not the side chain. 

In bi or more cyclic compounds we check the outermost ring (the biggest one). 

### Conditions
1. Cyclic
2. Ring should be Planar
3. Ring should be Unsaturated ($sp^{2}$ hybridised)
4. Ring should have Complete Conjugation
	- The whole ring needs to have resonance
5. $4n + 2$  conjugated $\pi$ electrons, where $n$ is any +ve integer. This is called **Huckle's Rule.**

$\pi$ e should be $2, 6,10,14,18,22,26,30, 34$ etc.

### Anti-Aromatic Compounds
Initial 4 conditions are same. 

In Anti-Aromatic compounds there are $4n$ conjugated $\pi$ electrons. (n cannot be zero)

These compounds are highly unstable at normal conditions.  

Order of Stability is,
$$\text{Aromatic > Non-Aromatic > Anti-Aromatic}$$ 

### On Aromatic Group
R effect: ortho = para 
HC effect: ortho = para 
I effect: ortho > meta > para 

### Annulenes
Completely conjugated monocyclic polyenes.

[8] Annulene is Non Planar and thus Non-Aromatic. It has a tub shaped structure. 
In fact, any Anti-Aromatic compound with more than 8 C in carbon is non planar and thus non aromatic. 

[10] Annulene is also non planar and  thus non aromatic. This is due to the H-H repulsion in the middle.

### Polar Aromatic Compounds (Quasi aromatic)
They are soluble in water due to polarity.

(the shifting will be such that both the rings become aromatic)

## Identification of Degree 
#### Of C and H
The number of C a C is connected to is it's degree. 

The degree of C to which H is connected to is it's degree. 

![[Pasted image 20230419202049.png]]

#### Alkyl Halides
The degree of C to which halogen is connected to is it's degree. 

![[Pasted image 20230419202443.png]]

#### Alcohols
The degree of C to which OH is connected to is it's degree. 

![[Pasted image 20230419202508.png]]

#### Amines
The number of C **N** is connected to is it's degree.

## Degree of Unsaturation
aka **Double Bond Equivalent**

It is a calculation that determines the total number of rings and $\pi$ bonds. 

DU = 0 means saturated compound. 

DU = 1 means 1 $\pi$ bond or 1 ring. 

DU = 2 means 2 $\pi$ bonds or 1 $\pi$ bond and 1 ring. 

![[Pasted image 20230419204740.png]]

When structure is given, DU can be calculated as,
**DU = no. of $\pi$ bonds + no. of rings**
(no of pi bonds include the pi bond in $\ce{ C=O }$)

![[Pasted image 20230419211111.png]]


When molecular formula is given.
$$\ce{ DU = C_{n} - \left( \frac{ H_{n} + X_{n} - N_{n} -2 }{ 2 } \right) }$$

or 
if the compound has only C, H and O then compare it with Alkane. Find the number of H which are less, then  half it for DU. 

if the compound has C, H and halogen, increase H by the number of halogen and then compare it with Alkane. 

if the compound has C, H and N, decrease H by the number of N and then compare with Alkane. 

Thus, O = ignore, X = +1 H, N = -1 H

Those which have same degree of unsaturation and same elements have the same general formula.
