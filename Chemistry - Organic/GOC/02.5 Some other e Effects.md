# Some other Effects
#### Baeyer's Angle Strain/Ring Strain
The difference between ideal and actual bond angles in cyclic compounds. 

The more the difference in bond angles, the more is the strain, the less is stability and the more is distortion in shape.

(the last row represents difference)

Due to angle strain, other than cyclopropane, all other are non-planar.

Due to very large angle strain in cyclopropane, it shows addition reaction and is thus unstable. 

Heat of combustion ($\Delta H$) is the heat released on complete combustion. The more it is the less stable the compound is. 

Thus for Isomers,
$$\Delta H \propto \frac{ 1 }{ \text{stability} }$$

As the number of C increases in alkanes, the heat of combustion increases. 
$$\Delta H \propto \text{ no. of C}$$

But per C, the heat of combustion is directly indicative of stability,

This is the reason why cyclopropyne does not exit. In fact, a triple bond does not exits until 7 C atoms. Thus, small cycloalkynes ($\ce{ C_{3} - C_{7} }$) cannot exist due to angle strain. 


#### Bredt's Rule
According to this rule conditions of planarity are not possible on bridgehead position of small bicyclic compound/ion (up to 7 membered ring). It is due to ring strain.

This rule is not application on fused ring containing bicyclic compound.

Bridge head atoms need to have at least one $\ce{ CH_{2} }$.

All the unstable ones want the C atom to become planar but the small ring wants it to be non planar which is not possible. 

Also, the H bonded to the bridgehead C does not do HC.

Using this rule, we can see where resonance is not possible,

#### SIR Effect
**Steric Inhibition in Resonance Effect**

**Steric Hinderance:** Repulsion between bulky groups. 

In some compounds/ions planarity of conjugated system is disturbed by steric hinderance. Thus resonance is disturbed. This effect is called SIR effect. 

This effect is only applicable in the presence of bulky groups like $\ce{ -NR_{2}, -NO_{2}, -COOH, -Br, -I }$.

This is the reason for order, $\ce{ -NH_{2} > -NR_{2} }$, of +M effect

Example,
![[Pasted image 20230617211639.png]]
Resonance does not happen because the p orbitals of N are no longer parallel to the p orbitals of benzene ring. 

Due to SIR,
1. Resonance Energy: A > B
2. C-N bond length: x < y 
3. e density on ring: A > B
3. e density on N: A < B
4. Basic Strength: A < B

If the planarity is guaranteed (c in this example), the resonance and thus the resonance energy is increased,
