# Resonance
Delocalisation of $\pi$ bond e in conjugated system. 

When one structure of a species cannot explain all properties of it, we use different canonical structures they are called **Resonating Structures.**

These canonical structures are hypothetical.

Some Bond Lengths. (all are in Armstrong)
- $\ce{ C-C = 1.54 }$
- $\ce{ C=C = 1.34 }$
- $\ce{ C#C = 1.20 }$
- $\ce{ -C-H = 1.10 }$
- $\ce{ =C-H = 1.09 }$
- $\ce{ #C-H = 1.06 }$
- $\ce{ C-O = 1.43 }$
- $\ce{ C=O = 1.23 }$

#### Resonance in Benzene 
Benzene was found to have 3 pi bonds. But it was found that each C-C bond length is 1.39 Armstrong which is between single and double. Due to which many structures were proposed. Benzene actually exists as a hybrid of all of them, which is more stable.

#### Resonance Hybrid
Resonance hybrid is the actual structure of compound or ion which can explain all the properties of compound. 
It is more stable than the resonating structures and thus it has less potential energy than the RS. Compound gains stability by delocalisation of e. 

More stable RS gives more contribution in resonance hybrid. 

Stability of hybrid $\propto$ number of stable RS

#### Resonance Energy
The energy gap between the most stable RS and resonance hybrid. 

It is a calculative or  theoretical value 

The more RE a compound has the more stable it is.

We calculate the value of the RS based on the other experimental data (e.g. bond energy of C-C etc.).

The decrease in E is due to resonance and thus it is called Resonance Energy.

### Rules for Resonating Structures
1. Resonance is possible only in planar/nearly planer conjugated systems in which adjacent p or d orbitals are present in same plane with parallel arrangement. 
   
   ![[Pasted image 20230607203104.png]]
   $\\$
   
2. The net charge remains same on each resonating structures. 
   ![[Pasted image 20230607203519.png]]
   $\\$

3. Only $\pi$-e of conjugated systems can participate in resonance. 
   ![[Pasted image 20230607203634.png]]
   $\\$
   
4. All RS must have same arrangement of atomic nuclei. Only the e move around. 
   ![[Pasted image 20230607203820.png]]
   $\\$

5. All RS have the same number of unpaired and paired e. 
   ![[Pasted image 20230607204006.png]]
   $\\$

1. Hybridisation of particular atom does not change. (amide is a special case where hybridisation in both the cases is $sp^{2}$)
   ![[Pasted image 20230607204123.png]]
	$\\$
	
2. In all RS atoms of 2nd period should follow octet rule. 
   ![[Pasted image 20230607204912.png]]

### Stability of Resonating Structures
1. Greater number of $\pi$ bond containing structures are more stable. 
2. Resonating structures in which all the atoms have complete octet are more stable.
3. Neutral RS are generally more stable than charged.
4. For charged RS
	1. -ve charge is more stable on larger sized atom (if comparison between atoms of same group)
	2. -ve charge is more stable on more EN atom and +ve charge on lower EN atom (when size of atoms is approx. the same)
	   $\\$
5. Aromatic RS are more stable than non-aromatic. 
6. -ve charge is more stable on adjacent position of e withdrawing group (EWG), similarly +ve charge is more stable adjacent position of e donating group (EDG). 
7. When conjugated no of $\pi$ e are the same then linear conjugating structures are mores stable than cross conjugated structures. 

## Types of Conjugation
{} - {} after leaving one bond
(mb-mb after leaving one bond)

1. **Multiple bond - Multiple bond** conjugation:
   In double and double bonds,
   ![[Pasted image 20230607210608.png]]
   
   In double and triple bonds, one of the two p orbitals will be in conjugation and the other will not be.  
   ![[Pasted image 20230607211118.png]]
   
   If two double bonds are adjacent to each other, the middle C atoms will have 2 p orbitals which will be perpendicular to each other and thus there will be no conjugation. 
   ![[Pasted image 20230607211503.png]]
   
   There could be a multiple bond between two multiple bonds also,
   ![[Pasted image 20230607212258.png]]
   
   In benzene, the conjugated pi e form rings above and below the C ring,
   ![[Pasted image 20230607212413.png]]
   
   $\\$
   
2. **Multiple bond - Lone pair** conjugation:
   Lone pairs are counted as pi e. 
   
   If lone pair is present, then it participates in resonance but not in hybridisation, the reason why $\ce{ -NH_{2} }$ is $sp^{2}$ hybridised instead of  $sp^{3}$.  
   The lp on N in amine is in p orbital instead of a $sp^{3}$ orbital, 
   ![[Pasted image 20230607213355.png]]
   
   Similarly, in O, one of the lp is in p orbital and participates in hybridisation, and the other lp is in one of the $sp^{3}$ orbitals. 
   ![[Pasted image 20230607213455.png]]
   $\\$

3. **Multiple bond - Vacant orbital** conjugation:
	![[Pasted image 20230607213902.png]]
	
	We have to be careful when N has +ve charge, as $\ce{ N+ }$ does not have a vacant orbital,
	![[Pasted image 20230607214934.png]]	
   $\\$

4. **Multiple bond - Free radicle** (unpaired e) conjugation:
   The free radicle e is in the p orbital.   
   ![[Pasted image 20230607214200.png]]
   $\\$
   
5. **Vacant orbital - Lone pair** conjugation:
   The vacant orbital could be of 3d also.
