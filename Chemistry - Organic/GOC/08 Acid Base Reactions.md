# Acid Base Reactions 
For an acid base reaction,

For forward reaction, the acid of reactant side should be stronger than acid of product side. Or, the base of reactant side should be stronger than base of product side.

$$\ce{ A-H > B-H }$$
$$\ce{ B- > A- }$$

To check whether reaction will move forward or not, make the products and then check either acidic or basic strength of product and reactant.

Generally, more than one OH on the same C is unstable, due to repulsion between the lone pairs. 
They lose an $\ce{ H_{2}O }$ to become carboxylic acid or carbonyl group.
