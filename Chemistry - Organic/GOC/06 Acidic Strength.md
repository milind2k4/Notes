# Acidic Strength

### Theories of Acids and Bases
[[13 Acids and Bases]]
[[01 Acids and Bases]]

#### Arrhenius Theory 
When adding water it releases $\ce{ H^{+} }$ they are acidic.
When adding water it releases $\ce{ OH^{-} }$ they are basic.

#### Bronsted Theory
If they release proton ($\ce{ H^{+} }$) regardless if solution is aq or not, they are acidic.
If they accept proton ($\ce{ H^{+} }$) regardless if solution is aq or not, they are basic.

#### Lewis Theory
If the accept lone pair i.e. have vacant orbital they are acid. 
If the donate lone pair i.e. have vacant orbital they are base. 

## Determining Strength

The Dissociation constant for AH acid,
$$\ce{ k_{a} = \frac{[A^{-}][H^{+}]}{[A-H]} }$$

##### Factors Affecting Acidic Strength

Acidic Strength increases with,
- $k_{a}$ (decreases with $pk_{a}$)
- **Stability of $\ce{ A^{-} }$ (conjugate base)** [[04 Intermediates and their Stability#General Order of Stability of Carbanions|(stability order)]]
- decrease in bond strength $\ce{ A-H }$
- $s$ character (only in same atom)
- oxidation number of central atom of $\ce{ A^{-} }$
- in presence of e withdrawing group (-R. -I) (increase the stability of $\ce{ A^{-} }$)
- decrease in e donating group (+R, +HC, +I) (decrease the stability of $\ce{ A^{-} }$)

Acidic Strength also depends on solvent. The more polar it is, the more acidic the compound is. 
It is also affected by [[12 Hydrogen Bonding]], [[02.5 Some other e Effects#SIR Effect]]



#### pH scale
[[03 Nature of Aqueous Solution#pH scale]]

The -ve of log of it will be,
$$pk_{a} = -\log k_{a}$$
the less the more acidic.
the more the more basic.

For conjugate acid base at 25 Celsius,
$$pk_{a} + pk_{b} = 14$$ 

We also have pH and pOH
$$\ce{ pH = -\log[H+] }$$
$$\ce{ pOH = -\log[OH-] }$$
$$\ce{ pH + pOH = 14 }$$


## General order of Acidic Strength

![[Pasted image 20230703213232.png]]

The bottom row is the conjugate bases. From here we can see the stability of anion and thus the order of strength.

Phenol is less stable than carboxylic acid even though phenoxide has 5 RS because in phenoxide the -ve charge is distributed over C atoms while in carboxylate the -ve charge is distributed over O atoms. O holds -ve charge better than C and thus is more stable. Also because only 2 of the 5 RS of phenoxide are aromatic. 

Alkyne anion is more stable than  ammonium anion (azanide) because $sp$ C is more EN than $sp^{3}$ N. 

In comparing we extensively use [[04 Intermediates and their Stability#Stability of Intermediates]]

More oxidation state means more EN as there is very little e density around that atom and thus EN and hence stability increases.

Picric acid is very acidic,

#### General Examples

Carbonic Acid,

Barbituric Acid

Oxalic, Malonic, Succinic, Glutaric, Adipic, Crotonic acid. 
![[Pasted image 20230705201016.png]]

#### Maleic and Fumaric Acid
Maleic acid is more acidic than Fumaric acid because maleic acid is stabilised by intramolecular H bonding.  
Thus $k_{a_{1}(m)} > k_{a_{1}(f)}$.

However, removing the second H is more difficult in Maleic acid than Fumaric acid. Thus, $k_{a_{2}(m)} < k_{a_{1}(f)}$,

#### Phenols
In Phenol derivatives,

In Cresols,

##### Ortho Effect on Phenol by H bonding Groups
![[Pasted image 20230705204741.png]]
The incorrect order is because due to intermolecular H bonding the H is not removed easily in o-isomer. In -CN there is no H bonding as it is linear. 

**Note:** When $\ce{ -NO_{2}, -CHO, -COR and -COOR }$ groups are present on o position of phenol then the o-isomers are less acidic than p-isomer only. This is due to intramolecular H bonding.

### Ortho rule for benzoic acid and its derivatives
If any group is attached at the ortho position then it is more acidic than n, m, p. 
o is most acidic. 

This is due to [[02.5 Some other e Effects#SIR Effect]]. The planarity is disturbed and the +M effect of the aromatic ring does not occur and the acidic strength is not decreased. The $\ce{ O- }$ only does resonance with $\ce{ C=O }$ and thus the acidic strength is more. 

![[Pasted image 20230705210139.png]]

In small groups like -F, ortho rule is not applied.
![[Pasted image 20230705210545.png]]

In Salicylic acid, the Salicylate anion formed by losing one H is highly stabilised due to H bonding. And since OH is a small group, ortho rule is not applied. 
![[Pasted image 20230705210922.png]]

H bonding is between ortho rule with -M and ortho rule with +M,
![[Pasted image 20230705211144.png]]

The bigger the group is, the more SIR effect is applies and the more acidic strength is increased,

### Some other Important Orders
Picric acid is more acidic than acetic acid,
![[Pasted image 20230705211612.png]]

Formic acid is more acidic than benzoic acid which is more acidic than acetic acid,
![[Pasted image 20230705211618.png]]

Active methylene group (AMG) is more acidic than even an aromatic anion of 5 C,
![[Pasted image 20230705211625.png]]

On the basis of $k_{a}$ values, the order of acidic strength are,
