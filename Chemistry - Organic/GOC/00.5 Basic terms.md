# Some Basic Terms of Organic Chemistry
1. **Organic Compounds:** Hydrocarbons and its derivatives. Contains tetravalent C, H (O, N, S, F, Cl, Br, I, P)

1. **Catenation:** Property of same atoms to form long chains. 
   C has max. catenation property because of it's Tetravalency and Strong C-C bond. 

1. **Saturated Compounds:** which have only single bonds between C. 

1. **Unsaturated Compounds:** which have at least one C-C multiple bond. 

1. **Homocyclic Compounds:** which have all the same atoms in the cyclic chain. 

1. **Heterocyclic Compounds:** which have at least one different atom in the cyclic chain.

1. **Molecular Formula:** indicating exact number of atoms of each element in one molecule.  

1. **Structural Formula:** indicating the structure or connectivity of the atoms in the molecule. 
   - *Expanded:* where every bond is shown.
   - *Condensed:* where only the major bonds are shown, and same unit is represented by subscripts $\ce{ CH_{3}-(CH_{2})2-CH_{3} }$
   - *Bond Line:* where C-C bonds are shown by straight lines. n C require n-1 lines. 
 
1. **Aliphatic Compounds:** non-aromatic compounds 

2. **Alicyclic Compounds:** cyclic aliphatic compounds or cyclic non-aromatic compounds.

1. **Homologous Series:** series of compounds in which members have same
    - functional group
    - general formula
    - chemical properties
    - degree of unsaturation
      
    but have different
    - molecular formula
    - empirical formula
    - physical properties
      
    Two members of homologous series differ by $\ce{ nCH_{2} }$. 
    
    Some Homologous Series are:
    Alkane: $\ce{ C_{n}H_{2n+2} }$
    Alkene: $\ce{ C_{n}H_{2n} }$
    Alkyne: $\ce{ C_{n}H_{2n-2} }$
    Alcohol: $\ce{ C_{n}H_{2n+1}OH }$

1. **Geminal Compounds:** when same group is attached to one C twice.

1. **Vicinal Compounds:** when same group is attached to two adjacent C.
