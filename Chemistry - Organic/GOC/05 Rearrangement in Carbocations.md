# Rearrangement in Carbocations
Migration of a group or an atom with bonding e on an adjacent e deficient atom. 

Rearrangement is possible in e deficient species, like carbocations, carbene, nitrene. 
It occurs very rarely in carbanions and free radicles.

Stability of product cation should be greater than stability of original cation. 
The shift is an **Intramolecular** phenomenon.

There are 5 types of shift 
1.  Hydride Shift (-H)
2. Alkyl Shift (-R)
3. Aryl Shift (-Ph)
4. Ring Expansion 
5. Ring Contraction

### Hydride Shift
H can only shift to it's adjacent C.
It will happen till the product formed is most stable.

Migration is through a transition state.

It can shift multiple times as long as more stable carbocations are formed, but it will only shift to adjacent H,

It cannot make a less stable compound just to make a more stable one in the next step. We can only go up the stability hill (like evolution).

It may even shift to another sec. C if stability increases,

It may even shift from a tert. to sec. if the stability increases,

### Alkyl Shift
Just like hydride shift. Except instead of H, Me shifts.

### Aryl Shift
Just like hydride shift. Except instead of H, Ph shifts.

### Ring Expansion
When +ve charge is present on adjacent C of 4 or 5 membered ring, then ring expansion is possible. The expanded ring carbocation is more stable because it has lesser ring strain. 

H shift also occurs, but is in very small amount.

For +ve charge on adjacent C of 6 membered ring, ring expansion does not happen because the new ring formed has more ring strain and thus only H shift occurs.

### Ring Contraction
When +ve charge is present on C of 4 or 7 membered ring, then ring contraction is possible. 

A bicyclic ring type transition state occurs. 

4 membered rings contract because of [[04 Intermediates and their Stability#Dancing Resonance]]
