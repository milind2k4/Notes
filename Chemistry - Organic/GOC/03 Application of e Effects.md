# Application of Electronic Effect
### Dipole Moment ($\mu$)
[[00 Chemical Bonding#Dipole Moment]]

Degree of polarity of bond. 
$$\vec{\mu} = q.\vec{d}$$
The charge factor is dominating. 
Except in methyl chloride and fluoride, where distance factor is dominating,
$$\ce{ CH_{3}-Cl > CH_{3}-F > CH_{3}-Br > CH_{3}-I }$$
But it only works for methyl. For any other alkane the order is as usual and the charge factor dominates.

The dipole moment of a mixture of A + B with A having dipole moment $\mu_{A}$ and mole fraction $x_{A}$ and B having dipole moment $\mu_{B}$ and mole fraction $x_{B}$ will be,
$$\mu_{mix} = \mu_{A}x_{A} + \mu_{B}x_{B}$$

#### Comparison of Dipole Moment
They have symmetrical placements of atoms. And thus the permanent dipole moment will be zero. 

Some non polar inorganic molecules,
$$\ce{ CO_{2}, BF_{3}, CCl_{4}, PCl_{5} }$$

In organic compounds, we compare using %s character,
$$\ce{ CH_{3}CH_{2}CH_{3} < CH_{3}CH=CH_{2} < CH_{3}C#CH }$$

The more the difference in EN is, the more polar the molecule is,
$$\ce{ CH_{3}CH_{2}-Cl > CH_{2}=CH-Cl }$$

The more is the angle between the bonds, in general the less is dipole moment,
$$\ce{ CH_{3}-Cl > CH_{2}-Cl_{2} > CH-Cl_{3} > C-Cl_{4} }$$

o-isomer is most polar if both the substituents are the same,

o-isomer is less polar if one of the substituents is e donating,
![[Pasted image 20230621201956.png]]

Ketone is more polar than Aldehyde. 

In water, alcohol and ether, water is most polar then alcohol, due to bond angles,

**Note:** 
In p-isomer, trans-isomers and anti conformation, with same group G,
![[Pasted image 20230621203841.png]]
- if G group is symmetrical like $\ce{ -CH_{3}, -CX_{3}, -CN, -NO_{2}, -COO- }$, $\mu = 0$, the molecule is non polar. 
- if G group is asymmetrical, like $\ce{ -OH, -OR, -SH, -SR, -COOH, -COOH, -NO, -CH_{2}-X, -CX_{2}-H }$, $\mu\neq 0$ and  the molecule is polar.


For example, if G is symmetrical,
![[Pasted image 20230621203923.png]]

For example, if G is asymmetrical, the dipole moments do not align and thus the molecule is polar,

## Stability of Alkene
Directly proportional to resonance and hyper conjugation.

For example,
![[Pasted image 20230621204640.png]]

##### Branched and Unbranched
When number of $\alpha$ H are same then branched alkenes are more stable. Due to presence of stronger bonds. This is found experimentally through heat of hydrogenation. 
![[Pasted image 20230621205403.png]]

Similarly, branched alkane isomers are more stable than unbranched ones because of presence of stronger bonds (greater number of primary C-H bonds).
![[Pasted image 20230621205421.png]]

Order of bond energy is,
$$\ce{ \underset{ 1^{\circ} }{ C }-H > \underset{ 2^{\circ} }{ C }-H > \underset{ 3^{\circ} }{ C }-H }$$
This is because, breaking tertiary C-H bond makes a more stable species and thus it breaks easily,
![[Pasted image 20230621205836.png]]

And thus a compound which has more number of stronger bonds is more stable. 
![[Pasted image 20230621205919.png]]

##### cis and trans isomer

If number of primary C-H bonds is also the same, trans-isomer is more stable than cis-isomer, due to less steric hinderance,
![[Pasted image 20230621210232.png]]

Thus the more steric hinderance, the less stable a compound is.

##### Linear and Cross Conjugation
Linear Conjugation is when everything is in conjugation. 
Cross Conjugation is when not everything is in conjugation.

![[Pasted image 20230621210801.png]]

When number of conjugated $\pi$ e are the same then Linear Conjugated structure is more stable than Cross Conjugated Structure. 

![[Pasted image 20230621210822.png]]
(the bottom has more conjugated $\pi$ e)


## Heats
### Heat of Hydrogenation 
[[01 Hydrogenation]]

The heat released when 1 mole alkene is converted to alkane by addition reaction. 

Heat is released because the C-H $\sigma$ bond is stronger than C-C $\pi$ bond.

Heat of Hydrogenation,
$$
\begin{split}
&\propto \text{no. of } \pi \text{ bonds} \\
&\propto \frac{ 1 }{ \text{stability of reactant} }
\end{split}
$$
the 2nd one is applied when no. of $\pi$ bonds is the same or in isomers. 

The more unstable the reactant is, the more potential energy it has. 

![[Pasted image 20230623170139.png]]

On hydrogenation, the compound will become alkane and thus will be most stable. Thus the most unstable releases the most heat of hydrogenation. 

![[Pasted image 20230623170117.png]]

Example,
![[Pasted image 20230623170656.png]]
(cumulated diene is least stable)

### Heat of Combustion
Heat release on combustion of 1 mole of compound.

Heat of combustion,
$$
\begin{split}
&\propto \text{no. of C} \\
&\propto \frac{ 1 }{ \text{stability of reactant} }
\end{split}
$$
Similar to Heat of Hydrogenation. 

![[Pasted image 20230623171001.png]]

The more unstable the compound is, the more it will be willing to break off its own bonds and thus will release more heat of combustion. 

Thus in alkanes, the more primary C-H bonds it has, the less heat it releases. 

![[Pasted image 20230623171249.png]]

### Heat of Formation
Heat released when 1 mole of that compound is formed. 

The more stable the compound is, the more heat of formation it has. 
$$\text{Heat of formation} \propto \text{stability of compound}$$

## Bond Length
Bond length,
$$
\begin{split}
&\propto \frac{ 1 }{ \text{multiplicity of bond} } \\
&\propto \frac{ 1 }{ \text{\% s character} }
\end{split}
$$

We can check bond length by looking at Resonance, HC, Inductive effects in that order.  Resonance contributes the most of everything (like single bond character, double bond character etc.). If single bond character increases, the bond length increases.

![[Pasted image 20230623172800.png]]

The more RS a compound has the more bond length it will have because e will be distributed more.
