## Determining Strength
![[Pasted image 20230708201326.png]]

$$\ce{ k_{b} = \frac{[B-H]}{[B^{-}][H^{+}]} }$$

##### Factors Affecting Basic Strength 
For Anionic Bases,
$$\ce{ basic strength \propto \frac{ 1 }{ stability of anion } }$$
[[04 Intermediates and their Stability#General Order of Stability of Carbanions]]

For Neutral Bases,
$$\ce{ basic strength \propto lp donating tendency or lp availability }$$
$$\ce{ basic strength \propto stability pf conjugate acid }$$

In general, basic strength increases with:
- $k_{b}$
- decrease in $s$ character 
- in presence of e donating group (+R, +HC, +I) on lp donating group (increase tendency to donate e)
- decrease with e withdrawing group (-R, -I) (decrease tendency to donate e)

Other factors like [[02.5 Some other e Effects#SIR Effect]], solvation effect, [[12 Hydrogen Bonding]], etc.

## General order of Basic Strength

### N containing Bases
![[Pasted image 20230708205411.png]]

$$\ce{ Imidine > Aliphatic amines > Aromatic amines > Amine }$$

Along a period basic strength decreases. Because electronegativity increases. 
Down a group basic strength increases. Because size increases, tendency to lose e increases. 

### Examples

If a lp is part of the aromatic ring, then it will not be donated lest the ring loses its aromaticity.

In b the lp does not participate in resonance.

Guanidine is the strongest N containing neutral base. This is because the conjugate acid formed by absorbing H is very stable and the lp on the double bonded N is localised and has max. e density. Here the $sp^{2}$ double bonded N is even more basic than an $sp^{3}$ N.

In these two here, the open chain one can undergo umbrella inversion and thus distribute its lp e density on both sides of N. The ring one cannot do that and thus its lp is localised.

In the first one, one single H makes 2 bonds of equal length and thus basicity increases as the cation is highly stable.

##### For Aliphatic Amines
#important 
When ammonia, pri, sec and tert. amines are added into water. H bonding and solvation is very less in tert., both of which increase stability of cation. Steric hinderance also increases as R groups are hydrophobic and this decreases stability. 

![[Pasted image 20230708211801.png]]

Talking all of this into account, sec. is the most basic. 
Thus, basic strength of aliphatic amines in polar solvent,
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
R = Me &: 2^{\circ} > 1^{\circ} > 3^{\circ} > NH_{3} \\
R = Et &: 2^{\circ} > 3^{\circ} > 1^{\circ} > NH_{3} \\
 }
\end{split}
$$
Unless some other condition is given, take this order. In most cases the ethyl one is the order that comes. 

However in gaseous state or in non polar solvent, the expected order is the correct one,
$$\ce{ 3^{\circ} > 2^{\circ} > 1^{\circ} > NH_{3} }$$

For example,

### For Aromatic Amines

### Ortho rule for aniline derivatives
If any group is attached at the ortho position of $\ce{ -NH_{2} }$ then basic strength decreases. It becomes less basic than n, m, p-isomers.

This is because due to steric hinderance there is lesser solvation of the cation formed by absorbing H.

### SIR Effect 
#important 

When substituent present on ortho position of $\ce{ -NR_{2} }$, then basic strength increases.

This is because due to steric hinderance, the planarity of $\ce{ -NR_{2} }$ is disturbed and thus the lp on N becomes localised.
