# Electronic Effects
Effects produced by partial or complete shifting of e in an atom or molecule. 

They are of 2 types:
1. **Permanent:** inductive (I), resonance (R)/mesomeric (M), hyperconjugation (HC)
2. **Temporary:** inductomeric, electromeric 

### Inductive Effect (I)
Effect due to partial displacement of $\sigma$ bond e towards more EN atom. 
Effects due to polarity of a bond. It only affects $\sigma$ bonds.

EN of various elements,
- F = 4 
- O = 3.5
- Cl = 3.16
- N = 3.0 
- Br = 2.96
- I = 2.66 
- S = 2.56 
- C = 2.55
- H = 2.1 
- P = 2.19

H is taken as the reference atom, and thus its inductive effect is zero. 
It does not work on the 4th molecule. I.e. it decreases with distance form the $-I$ group.

It is a permanent effect.

Types of I groups: 
1. **-I:** groups which withdraw $\sigma$ bond e.
2. **+I:** groups which donate $\sigma$ bond e.

#### Relative Strength of -I 
on the basis of experimental data

$$\ce{ -N+F_{3} > -N+R_{3} > -S+R_{2} > -N+H_{3} > -NO_{2} > -SO_{3}H > -CN > -CHO }$$
$$\ce{ > -COR > -COOH > -CONH_{2} > -F > -Cl > -Br > -I > -OR > -OH } $$
$$\ce{ > -C#C-H > -NH_{3} > -Ph > -CH=CH_{2} > H }$$

EN $\propto$ % s character
$$\ce{ N_{sp} > N_{sp^{2}} > C_{sp} > N_{sp^{3}} > C_{sp^{2}} > C_{sp^{3}} }$$

D > N > P: Distance > Number > Power

#### Relative Strength of +I 
on the basis of experimental data

$$\ce{ -C^{-}H_{2} > -N^{-}H > -O^{-} > -COO^{-} > \underset{ 3^{\circ} }{ -CR_{3} } > \underset{ 2^{\circ} }{ -CR_{2} } > \underset{ 1^{\circ} }{ -CR } > -CH_{3} > -D > -H }$$
D has more +I effect than H because it has more mass and shows shorter bond distance and thus there is more e density around the C in $\ce{ CD_{3} }$ than there is in $\ce{ CH_{3} }$. 

Alkyl are e donating because C is more EN than H and thus C has more e, so it can donate,

However, if alkyl is connected to a less EN atom, then it becomes -I. 

+I effect is directly proportional to number of C for alkyl groups with same degree,

### Resonance Effect
Effects produced by [[01 Resonance]], delocalisation of e in conjugated systems. 

There are two types of Mesomaric Groups.
1. +M group: $\pi$ e donating groups in conjugated system. Generally they are those groups which have lone pair on first atom.
   
   Order is,
   ![[Pasted image 20230614202535.png]]
   
   Explanation: -ve charge first with less EN atom first, N then O, N containing first because less EN than O,  amide then ester because they have carbonyl group which is EWG, amide first because N is less EN than O, then C-C double bond and finally halogen. 

	Lone pair provides more +M than C-C multiple bond.
   
   Also, the more R groups there are the more disturbance there is in planarity and thus in resonance. 
   
   In halogens, the order is reverse because the size of orbitals increases and thus the effective e overlapping is less. 
   
   ![[Pasted image 20230614204110.png]]
   
   We also use this to compare O and S in +M and -I effect,
   $$\ce{ +M: -OH > -SH }$$
   $$\ce{ -I: -OH > -SH }$$
   $\\$
   
2. -M group: $\pi$ e withdrawing groups in conjugated systems. The first atom of these groups have a multiple bond with more EN atom or vacant orbital. 
   
   Order is
   ![[Pasted image 20230614204631.png]]
   
	The reason for order of carbonyl like groups is that 
	In aldehyde and ketone, since ketone has an R group which is an EDG, aldehyde has more -M effect. 
	
	In esters and anhydrides, the single bonded O in ester donates e easier than anhydrides because the lp on single bonded O in it also resonates with the other carbonyl group.
	
	Thus, on carbonyl group, the more EDG it has, the less -M effect it has. 

The existence of + M or -M groups only happens when there is conjugation,

Groups which can show both +M as well as -M effect,

Between I and M effect, M is more potent.
The formation of polarity due to Resonance.

Temporary effect

There is no conjugation at meta position of the benzene ring, therefore any group does not show mesomeric effect. But they can show I effect.

### Hyperconjugation (HC)
Also called **No bond resonance** or ***Baker Nathan*** effect. 

When C-H or C-D $\sigma$ bonds of $sp^{3}$ C present on adjacent position of $\ce{ C=C/C#C/C+/C^{.} }$ then these C-H/D $\sigma$ bonds overlap with adjacent $\pi /\pi^{*} /p$ orbital. This delocalisation is called hyperconjugation. 

$\sigma,\ p$ or $\sigma$, $\pi$ interaction.

HC is possible in following types of structures,

HC in Alkenes,

HC in Carbonium ion,

HC in Free Radicle,
![[Pasted image 20230614212656.png]]

HC in aromatic ring,
![[Pasted image 20230614212922.png]]
(in total there are 9 HC structures)

HC is electron donating effect. 

The +ve charge got distributed to all the H atoms. Thus the stability increases. Thus the more HC, the more stable. 

C-D bond is stronger than C-H bond and thus the HC effect will be a little bit less. 

Effectivity order:
$$\ce{ Mesomeric > Hyperconjugation > Inductive }$$
In M, complete pi e are transferred, in HC, sigma bonds are transferred and in I some e density is transferred.
