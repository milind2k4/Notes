$$k_{a} = \frac{ x(s+x) }{ a-x }$$

Due to the presence of $\ce{ A- }$ ion in the solution, the equilibrium is shifted in the backward direction. Due to this, concentration of acid and salt are comparable then $x \ll s$ and $x \ll a$. 

Then,
$$k_{a} = \frac{ xs }{ a }$$
$$x = \frac{ k_{a}a }{ s }$$
This is the concentration of $\ce{ H+ }$,
$$\ce{ [H+] = \frac{ k_{a}a }{ s } }$$
Thus pH,
$$\ce{ pH = pk_{a} + \log \frac{ s }{ a } }$$
$$\ce{ pH = pk_{a} + \log \frac{ [salt] }{ [acid] } }$$
This equation is called **Henderson Equation.**
It is applicable when $k_{a}$ is small and $a$ (conc of acid) is high and concentration off acid and salt i.e. $a$ and $s$ are comparable (10, 20, up to 100x's difference)

Similarly we can write equation for basic buffer,
$$\ce{ pOH = pk_{b} + \log \frac{ [salt] }{ [base] }  }$$
It is applicable when $k_{b}$ is small and $b$ (conc of base) is high and concentration off acid and salt i.e. $b$ and $s$ are comparable (10, 20, up to 100x's difference)

(pH at the top is the ans to part 2)

Here since salt and base are in the same solution, the volume will be common and thus cancel out and the ratio of concentration will be the same as that of moles,

In case there are acid and bases, we have to react them and then find if they are buffer or not,

Only conjugate acid base pairs will remain in solution. Otherwise they will react. The reaction chains until there's only conjugate pairs in the solution. #important

### Simple Buffer
Since the [[06.1 Salt of WA and WB|salt is of weak acid and base]], we can simply write,
$$\ce{ pH = \frac{1}{2}(pk_{w} + pk_{a} - pk_{b}) }$$
