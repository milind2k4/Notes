# Nature of Aqueous Solution
If $\ce{ [H+] > [OH-] }$ then the solution is acidic.
If $\ce{ [H+] < [OH-] }$ then the solution is basic.
If $\ce{ [H+] = [OH-] }$ then the solution is neutral.

An aqueous solution is termed acidic basic or neutral at a given temp based on $\ce{ [H+] }$ of pure water at same temp..
Thus at 25 $^{\circ}$C, the reference value is,
$$\ce{ [H+] = 10^{-7} }$$

If in an aqueous solution, 
- $\ce{ [H+] } > 10^{-7}$, then acidic
- $\ce{ [H+] } < 10^{-7}$, then basic
- $\ce{ [H+] } = 10^{-7}$, then neutral

### pH scale
It was devised by Sorenson.

It is the -ve of logarithm of total $\ce{ [H+] }$ in solution,
$$\ce{ pH = -\log [H+] }$$
$$\ce{ pOH = -\log [OH-] }$$
At 25 $^{\circ}$C, for pure water,
$$\ce{ pH = pOH = 7 }$$

Also, $\ce{ [H+] = [OH-] }$ for all temp for pure water and thus water is neutral. 
$$\ce{ pk_{a(H_{2}O)} = pk_{b(H_{2}O)} = 15.74 }$$

Similarly we defined,
$$\ce{ pk_{a} = -\log [k_{a}] }$$
$$\ce{ pk_{b} = -\log [k_{b}] }$$
$$\ce{ pk_{w} = -\log [k_{w}] }$$
The more is $\ce{ pk_{a} }$ for an acid, the less is its strength.
The more is $\ce{ pk_{b} }$ for a base, the less is its strength.

At 25$^{\circ}$C for an aqueous solution,
- if $\ce{ pH < 7 }$ solution will be acidic
- if $\ce{ pH > 7 }$ solution will be basic
- if $\ce{ pH = 7 }$ solution will be neutral

The solution can be basic even if pH is less than 7. It depends on temp. 
In which case we need to find the value of neutral pH.

On increasing temp, pH, pOH and $k_{w}$ decrease. 
On decreasing temp, pH, pOH and $k_{w}$ increases. 

#### Some things to Note
1. $\ce{ H+, OH- }$ do not remain in water in free form. 
   They are in hydrated form,
   $$\ce{ H+ + H_{2}O -> H_{3}O+ }$$
	In fact small amount of $\ce{ H_{5}O_{2}+, H_{7}O_{3}+ }$ etc are also found in the solution.
	
	Similarly, $\ce{ OH- }$ gets hydrated to form $\ce{ H_{3}O_{2}- }$
	$\\$

2. If $\ce{ H_{2}O }$ is considered base, then $\ce{ H_{3}O+ }$ is conjugate acid. 

	$$
	\begin{split}
	\ce{ 
	pk_{a(H_{3}O^{+})} + pk_{b(H_{2}O)} &= pk_{w} \\
	pk_{a(H_{3}O^{+})} &= 14 - 15.74\\
	&= -1.74
	 }
	\end{split}
	$$
	Any acid stronger than $\ce{ H_{3}O+ }$ is considered strong acid. $\ce{ H_{3}O+ }$ is itself a strong acid.
	Thus order of acidic strength is,
	$$\ce{ \underbrace{ HClO_{4} > HI > HBr > HCl > HNO_{3} }_{ strong acid } > \underbrace{ H_{3}PO_{4} > HCOOH > CH_{3}COOH > HCN }_{ weak acid } }$$

3. If $\ce{ H_{2}O }$ is considered acid, then $\ce{ OH- }$ is conjugate base. 

$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
pk_{a(H_{2}O)} + pk_{b(OH^{-})} &= pk_{w} \\
pk_{b(OH^{-})} &= 14 - 15.74 \\
&= -1.74 
 }
\end{split}
$$
Any base stronger than $\ce{ OH- }$ is a strong base. $\ce{ OH- }$ is itself a strong base.
Thus, very strong acids are,
$$\ce{ O^{2-}, H-, CH_{3}-, NH_{2}- }$$
