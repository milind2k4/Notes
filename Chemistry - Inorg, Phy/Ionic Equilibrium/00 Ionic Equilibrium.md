# Ionic Equilibrium
Types of electrolytes,
1. **Strong:** which dissociate almost completely in solution phase.
   Their solutions are highly conductive. 
   
   Strong acids (mineral acids): $\ce{ BCl, HBr, HI, HNO_{3}, H_{2}SO_{4}, HClO_{3} }$ etc.. 
   
   Strong bases: $\ce{ NaOH, KOH, RbOH, CsOH, Ba(OH)2, Sr(OH)2 }$ etc.
   Salts: $\ce{ NaCl, KBr, BaCl_{2}, NaNO_{3} }$ etc.
   (Salts are considered strong electrolyte)
   $\\$
   
1. **Weak:** which dissociate partially in solution phase. 
   Their solutions are weakly conducting. 
   
   Weak Acids: $\ce{ RCOOH, HCN, HOCN, \underset{ carbonic acid }{ H_{2}CO_{3} }, H_{3}PO_{4} }$ etc.
   
   Weak Bases: $\ce{ NH_{4}OH, \underset{ anilinium hydroxide }{ C_{6}H_{5}NH_{3}OH } }$
   
	*"The weaker electrolyte is affected more."* 
	Whether it is in common ion effect or concentration, the one with less $k$ will be affected more. 
	$\\$

3. **Non-Electrolytes:** which do no dissociate in solution phase.
   Their solutions are non conducting. 
   
   Examples: $\ce{ C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}, NH_{2}CONH_{2}, C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}, ROH }$ etc. 
   
## Salts Containing Amphiprotic Anions
Amphiprotic Anion means those which can both gain and lose proton. 

Salts which contain at least one acidic H. 
For example,
$$\ce{ NaHCO_{3}, NaHS, NaHC_{2}O_{4}, NaH_{2}PO_{4}, Na_{2}HPO_{4}, NaH_{2}PO_{3}, etc. }$$

On adding water,
$$\ce{ NaHCO_{3} ->[+ H_{2}O  {}_{(l)}] Na+ + \underset{ amphiprotic anion }{ HCO_{3}- } }$$

Behaving as an acid,
$$\ce{ HCO_{3}- + H_{2}O <=> H_{3}O+ + CO_{3}^{2-} }$$

Behaving as a base,
$$\ce{ HCO_{3}- + H_{2}O <=> H_{2}CO_{3} + OH- }$$

## Levelling Effect
$$\ce{ HCl <=> H+ + Cl- }$$
$$\ce{ HBr <=> H+ + Br- }$$
$$\ce{ HI <=> H+ + I- }$$
All three are almost completely ionised and hence are equally strong acid. All of them give 1 M $\ce{ [H+] }$

Water has brought these acids on same level of acidic strength and hence water is called levelling solvent and the effect is know as **levelling effect.**

Thus acidic strength cannot be compared in levelling solvent. 

To compare acidic strength of these acids, we should use a solvent which is a weaker base than water like $\ce{ HCOOH, CH_{3}COOH }$.

$$\ce{ HCl + CH_{3}COOH <=> Cl- + CH_{3}COOH_{2}+ }$$
Since acetic acid is weaker acid than HCl, it behaves as base here. 

$$\ce{ HBr + CH_{3}COOH <=> Br- + CH_{3}COOH_{2}+ }$$
$$\ce{ HI + CH_{3}COOH <=> I- + CH_{3}COOH_{2}+ }$$

Now we can compare the strength and find the order of acidic strength,
$$\ce{ HI > HBr > HCl }$$

Since we could compare the strengths of these acids, acetic acid here is called **differentiating solvent.** 

Similarly, $\ce{ HCOOH, H_{2}O, CH_{3}COOH }$ act as levelling solvent for strong bases like $\ce{ NaOH, KOH, RbOH, CsOH }$, and $\ce{ NH_{3} }$ is differentiating solvent. 

## Complexation Equilibrium 
[[10 Heterogeneous Equilibrium]]
Many water insoluble salts become soluble in presence of complexing ligand. 

E.g. AgCl is only sparingly soluble in water, but becomes soluble in complexing ligand (which can form complex) ammonia. This is because formation constant (a type of equilibrium constant) of $\ce{ [Ag(NH_{3})2]+ }$ is very high and thus the reaction is pulled in the forward direction.

#### Formation Constant
It is also called **Stability Constant.** This is because the larger it is the more the reaction is shifted in the forward direction, i.e. the product is more stable.

Thus $k_{f} \uparrow \implies$ Stability of complex $\uparrow$

The reaction,
$$\ce{ Ag+ + 2NH_{3} <=> [Ag(NH_{3})2]+ }$$
Occurs in 2 steps,
$$\ce{ Ag+ + NH_{3} <=> [Ag(NH_{3})]+, k_{f_{1}} = \frac{ [Ag(NH_{3})]+ }{ [Ag+] [NH_{3}] } }$$

$$\ce{ [Ag(NH_{3})]+ + NH_{3} <=> [Ag(NH_{3})2]+, k_{f_{2}} = \frac{ [Ag(NH_{3})2]+ }{ [Ag(NH_{3})]+ [NH_{3}] } }$$

Adding them, we get the reaction which has formation constant which is called the *overall formation constant*,
$$k_{f} = \ce{ \frac{ [Ag(NH_{3})2]+ }{ [Ag+] [NH_{3}]^{2} } }$$

**Note:** for the reverse reaction,
$$\ce{ [Ag(NH_{3})2]+ <=> Ag+ + 2NH_{3}, k_{i} = \frac{ 1 }{ k_{f} } }$$
where $k_{i}$ is **Instability Constant.**

## Amphoterism
Some compounds like $\ce{ Zn(OH)2, Al(OH)3, Cr(OH)3 }$ etc. are sparingly soluble in water, but are soluble in acids and bases due to their amphoteric nature. 

$$\ce{ \underset{ base }{ Zn(OH)2 {}_{(s)} } + 2HCl -> ZnCl_{2} + 2H_{2}O }$$
$$\ce{ \underset{ acid }{ Zn(OH)2 {}_{(s)} } + 2NaOH -> Na_{2}[Zn(OH)4] }$$

Thus the solubility vs pH curve will be like,

## Misc. Examples
If there is polybasic acid reacting with monoacidic base, the reaction will occur in steps. #revision

The higher is the $k_{a}$ the stronger is the acid and thus the lower is the pH when starting titration,
