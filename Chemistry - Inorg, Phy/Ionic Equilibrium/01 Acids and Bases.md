# Acids and Bases
Symbolically we write $\ce{ HA, H_{2}A, H_{3}A etc. }$ for acids and $\ce{ BOH, B(OH)2 }$ for bases.

Here we need **Bronsted Lowry Approach** and we thus expand on it.

In the reaction,
$$\ce{ \underset{ acid 1 }{ HCl } + \underset{ base 1 }{ H_{2}O } <=> \underset{ acid 2 }{ H_{3}O+ } + \underset{ base 2 }{ Cl- } }$$
This reaction is almost completely shifted in the forward direction and thus the $k_{eq}$ is very high. Due to this the reactants are strong acids and bases. 

Thus, high value of $k_{eq}$ of an acid base reaction indicates that reactant acid and base are strong.

In another reaction,
$$\ce{ CH_{3}COOH + H_{2}O <=> CH_{3}COO- + H_{3}O+ }$$
This reaction has small $k_{eq}$ and thus the reactants are weak acid and base. 

In Bronsted Lowry approach, we cannot defined acid and base separately. They are always defined in conjecture with each other. 

#### Conjugate Acid Base Pair
Pair of species that differ by 1 proton ($\ce{ H+ }$). 
Thus in the reaction,
$$\ce{ HCl + H_{2}O <=> H_{3}O+ + Cl- }$$
The conjugate base of $\ce{ HCl }$ is $\ce{ Cl- }$.
The conjugate acid of $\ce{ H_{2}O }$ is $\ce{ H_{3}O+ }$.

To write conjugate base we remove one proton. 
Thus the conjugate base of $\ce{ NH_{3} }$ will be $\ce{ NH_{2}- }$. 
To write conjugate acid we add one proton. 
Thus the conjugate acid of $\ce{ NH_{3} }$ will be $\ce{ NH_{4}+ }$.

In case of different species, make ion by removing everything other than H,

In many questions we need to know the [[04 Lewis Dot Strucutures|LDS]] of the [[04.1 LDS of some Oxoacids|acids and bases]], the ones which cannot lose acidic H cannot form conjugate base.

##### Strength of Conjugate Acid Base
Conjugate base of a very strong acid is a weak base.

Conjugate base of a moderately weak acid is a weak base. #important 
For a conjugate acid base pair, 
$$k_{a} \times k_{b} = k_{w}$$
where,
$k_{a} \to$ k of acid 
$k_{b} \to$ k of conjugate base
$k_{w} \to$ Ionic Product of Water, which is $10^{-14}$ at 25$^{\circ}$C

Only conjugate acid-base pair of species can remain in aqueous solution in appreciably high concentration.

### Relation b/w $k_{a}$ and $k_{b}$ for Conjugate Acid Base Pair

Let HA is a weak acid. Its conjugate base will be $\ce{ A- }$.
In water,
$$\ce{ HA <=> H+ + A-, k_{a} = \frac{ [H+] [A-] }{ [HA] } }$$
$$\ce{ A- + H_{2}O {}_{(l)} <=> HA + OH-, k_{b} = \frac{ [HA] [OH-] }{ [A-] } }$$
Now, multiplying and dividing by $\ce{ [H+] }$,
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
k_{b} &= \frac{ [HA] [OH-] }{ [A-] } . \frac{ [H+] }{ [H+] } \\
&= \frac{ [HA] }{ [A-] [H+] } . [H+] [OH-] \\
&= \frac{ 1 }{ k_{a} } . k_{w} \\
k_{a} \times k_{b} &= k_{w}
 }
\end{split}
$$
Hence proved.

Thus for a conjugate acid base pair,
$$k_{a} \times k_{b} = k_{w}$$

Taking log both sides,
$$
\begin{split}
\log k_{a} + \log k_{b} &= \log k_{w} \\
-\log k_{a} - \log k_{b} &= -\log k_{w} \\
\ce{ pk_{a} + pk_{b} &= pk_{w} } 
\end{split}
$$
This is applicable for any conjugate acid base pair in aqueous solution.
