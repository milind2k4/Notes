# Acid Base Titration 
### Titration of SA vs SB 
![[Pasted image 20230710205512.png]]

At start, the pH is known. 

Now after the start of titration and  before the equivalence point, the base is the limiting reagent and the acid is left over. 

At equivalence point, both acid and base react completely and the pH becomes 7 as both the acid and base are strong. 

After equivalence point, the acid becomes limiting reagent.

As we move closer to the equivalence point, the amount of $\ce{ H+ }$ remaining becomes less and less and thus adding even a small amount of base changes the concentration quite a bit.

### Titration of WA vs SB
![[Pasted image 20230710205522.png]]

At start  pH can be calculated,
$$pH = \frac{1}{2} (pk_{a} - \log c)$$

Before the equivalence point, the base is the limiting reagent and the solution becomes buffer. 
$$\ce{ CH_{3}COOH + NaOH -> CH_{3}COONa + H_{2}O }$$
Its pH being.
$$pH = pk_{a} + \log \frac{s}{a}$$

At equivalence point, both the acid and base are consumed completely. And only $\ce{ CH_{3}COONa }$ is in the solution, whose pH is,
$$pH = \frac{ 1 }{ 2 } (pk_{w} + pk_{a} + \log c)$$
which will be greater than 7.

In this titration MOH cannot be used and HPh is a suitable indicator here.

Titration of a very WA (like $\ce{ H_{3}BO_{3} }$ with $k_{a}   10^{-9}$) or very WB cannot be performed as no steep section in their titration curve is present.

### Titration of WB vs SA
![[Pasted image 20230710211059.png]]

At start, the pOH is,
$$pOH = \frac{1}{2} (pk_{b} - \log c)$$
and the pH will be more than 7 and the graph will start from the top.

Before the equivalence point, the acid is limiting reagent and thus it forms a basic buffer. 
$$\ce{ NH_{4}OH + HCl -> NH_{4}Cl + H_{2}O }$$
The pOH will be,
$$pOH = pk_{b} + \log\frac{ s }{ b }$$

At equivalence point the pH is less than 7 as only salt of WB and SA remains,
$$\ce{ NH_{4}OH + HCl -> NH_{4}Cl + H_{2}O }$$
$$pH = \frac{1}{2}(pk_{w} - pk_{b} - \log c)$$
This pH is less than 7.

Here MOH is suitable indicator.

### Titration of WA vs WB
![[Pasted image 20230711213239.png]]

At start, only acid is there,
$$pH = \frac{ 1 }{ 2 }(pk_{a} - \log c)$$

Before the equivalence point,
$$\ce{ CH_{3}COOH + NH_{4}OH -> CH_{3}COONH_{4} + H_{2}O }$$
Solution contains $\ce{ CH_{3}COOH + CH_{4}COO- }$, which is a buffer and thus a buffer region is observed. 

At equivalence point, both the acid and base are completely  exhausted and only $\ce{ CH_{3}COONH_{4} }$ remains which is a simple buffer and thus there is again buffer region. 

Thus there is no sharp change in pH and hence we cannot take any indicator. Therefore, this type of titration cannot be performed in this way.

### Titration of $\ce{ H_{3}PO_{4} }$ vs NaOH
NaOH is titrant. 

![[Pasted image 20230711214034.png]]

There will be multiple equivalence points,
1st equivalence point,
$$\ce{ H_{3}PO_{4} + NaOH -> NaH_{2}PO_{4} + H_{2}O }$$
2nd equivalence point,
$$\ce{ H_{3}PO_{4} + 2NaOH -> Na_{2}HPO_{4} + 2H_{2}O }$$
3rd equivalence point,
$$\ce{ H_{3}PO_{4} + 3NaOH -> Na_{3}PO_{4} + 3H_{2}O }$$

Before each equivalence point there will be a buffer region.

### Titration of $\ce{ Na_{2}CO_{3} }$ vs HCl
HCl is titrant.

There will be two equivalence points,
1st equivalence point,
$$\ce{ Na_{2}CO_{3} + HCl -> NaHCO_{3} + NaCl }$$
2nd equivalence point,
$$\ce{ Na_{2}CO_{3} + 2HCl -> H_{2}CO_{3} + 2NaCl }$$

Before each equivalence point, there is buffer action.
