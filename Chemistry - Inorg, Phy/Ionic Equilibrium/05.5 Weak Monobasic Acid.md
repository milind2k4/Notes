# Weak Monobasic Acid or Monoacidic Base
Let HA be weak monobasic acid,
$$\ce{ HA <=> H+ + A- }$$

##### Approximations 
1. If concentration of weak acid is high, i.e. $c \geq 10^{-2}$ M, then $\alpha \ll 1$. ([[02 Arrhenius Theory and Ostwald's Law#Ostwald Dilution Law|Ostwald's Dilution Law]]) 
   We approximate, $1-\alpha \approx 1$. 
   
	$$k_{a} = c \alpha^{2}$$
	$$\alpha = \sqrt{ \frac{ k_{a} }{ c } }$$
	$$\ce{ [H+] } = c \alpha = \sqrt{ c .k_{a} }$$
	
	Giving pH, when $\alpha \leq 0.1$
	$$\ce{ pH = \frac{ 1 }{ 2 } ( pk_{a} - \log c) }$$

	For a monoacidic base, when $\alpha \leq 0.1$
	$$\ce{ pOH = \frac{1}{2} (k_{b} - \log c) }$$

2. If solution of weak acid is dilute, i.e. $\ce{ 10^{-6} M \leq c < 10^{-2} }$, $\alpha$ is appreciably high and thus cannot be ignored. Thus we will have to solve quadratic. 
   
   $$k_{a} = \frac{ c \alpha }{ 1 - \alpha }$$
	to find $\alpha$ and then 
	$$\ce{ [H+] = c \alpha }$$

3. If solution of WA is extremely dilute, i.e. $c < 10^{-6}$ M, the WA behaves as a SA and thus $\alpha \approx 1$. Then go to case 2 of strong acid.

**Note:** #important 
The first two cases are based on only concentration of WA or WB solution. This is a flaw. However, $\alpha$ depends on both $k_{a}$ and $c$. 

To find correct pH, first
1. Calculate approximate value of $\alpha$ from the expression,
	$$\alpha = \sqrt{ \frac{ k_{a} }{ c } }$$
2. If this approximate value is $\leq 0.1$ then go to case 1, else go to case 2. 

We can also ignore the amount dissociated if $\alpha$ is very less.

If $\alpha$ is big however, we cannot ignore amount dissociated,

(here we can also see that since pH is log scale, even slight change matters and thus there is considerable difference in concentration of $\ce{ [H+] }$ between 3.5 and 3.56 )

##### Relative Acidic Strength 

When $\alpha \leq 0.1$,
$$\ce{ \frac{ [H+]_{HX} }{ [H+]_{HY} } = \frac{ \sqrt{ k_{a(HX)} . c_{1} } }{ k_{a(HY)}. c_{2} } }$$

##### Isohydric Solution
Solutions which furnish same concentration of common ion and $\alpha$ of both the solutions remains unchanged on mixing in any proportion.
