# Properties of Water
(Self or Auto ionisation of water)

$$\ce{ H_{2}O {}_{(l)} <=> H+ {}_{(aq)} + OH- {}_{(aq)} }$$

Similar to liquid water, many liquids self ionisation. 
$$\ce{ 2HCOOH <=> HCOO- + HCOOH_{2}+ }$$
$$\ce{ 2NH_{3} <=> NH_{4}+ + NH_{2}- }$$
$$\ce{ 2BrF_{3} <=> BrF_{2}+ + BrF_{4}- }$$
$$\ce{ N_{2}O_{4} <=> NO+ + NO_{3}- }$$

Since water gives both $\ce{ H+ }$ and $\ce{ OH- }$, we can defined both $k_{a}$ and $k_{b}$ for it. 

$$\ce{ k_{a} = k_{b} = \frac{ [H+] [OH-] }{ [H_{2}O] } }$$
now, since $\ce{ [H_{2}O] }$ is constant and at a fixed temp $k$ is constant,
$$\ce{ k_{a} \times [H_{2}O] = [H+][OH-] }$$
Here the LHS is called $k_{w}$ or **Ionic Product** since it is constant at a temp. 
$$\ce{ k_{w} = [H+] [OH-] }$$

For pure water, $\ce{ [H+] = [OH-] }$
$$k_{w} = \ce{ [H+]^{2} }$$
At 25 $^{\circ}$C in pure water, 
$$\ce{ [H+] = [OH-] = 10^{-7} M }$$
Giving,
$$k_{w} = 10^{-14}$$

We can also define Ionic Product for other liquids also,
$$\ce{ 2HCOOH <=> HCOO- + HCOOH_{2}+ }$$
Ionic Product,
$$\ce{ k = [HCOO-] [HCOOH_{2}+] }$$

Now,
$$\alpha_{\ce{ H_{2}O }} = 1.8 \times 10^{-9}$$
Out of a billion water molecules 1.8 are completely ionised. 

Also,
$$k_{a} = \frac{ 10^{-14} }{ 1000 /18 } = 1.8 \times 10^{-16}$$

Acid Base Neutralisation reaction,
$$\ce{ H+ + OH- -> H_{2}O }$$
which is exothermic always. 

Self ionisation of water is the reverse of Acid Base neutralisation and is thus endothermic. Thus, increasing the temperature increases $\alpha, \ce{ [H+], [OH-], k_{w} }$
