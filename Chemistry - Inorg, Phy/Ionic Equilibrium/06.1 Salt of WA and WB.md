# Salt of WA and WB
Like $\ce{ Ch_{3}COONH_{4}, NH_{4}CN etc. }$

It is the case of hydrolysis of both cation and anion. The final solution may be acidic, neutral or basic. 

$$\ce{ B+ + A- + H_{2}O <=> BOH + HA }$$
where the ions $\ce{ B+ }$ and $\ce{ A- }$ come from the WB and WA respectively.

Now, both the ions may have different extents of hydrolysis, i.e. $h_{1},h_{2}$. 
But $h_{1}, h_{2}$ are nearly equal, so $h_{1} = h_{2}$ can be approximated. 

We can write,
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
k_{h} &= \frac{ [BOH] [HA] }{ [B+] [A-] } \\
\\
&= \frac{ [BOH] [HA] [H+][OH-] }{ [B+] [A-] [H+][OH-] } \\ 
\\
&= [H+][OH-] \frac{ [HA] }{ [A-] [H+] } \frac{ [BOH] }{ [B+] [OH-] } \\
&= \frac{ k_{w} }{ k_{a}\times k_{b} }
 }
\end{split}
$$

In terms of $h$,
$$
\begin{split}
k_{h} &= \left( \frac{ h }{ 1-h } \right)^{2} \\
\frac{ 1-h }{ h } &= \frac{ 1 }{ \sqrt{ k_{h} } } \\
\frac{ 1 }{ h } &= 1 + \frac{ 1 }{ \sqrt{ k_{h} } } \\
h &= \frac{ \sqrt{ k_{h} } }{ 1 + \sqrt{ k_{h} } } 
\end{split} 
$$
Thus, the expression of h is obtained without any approximations other than $h_{1} = h_{2}$. 
$$h = \frac{ \sqrt{ k_{h} } }{ 1 + \sqrt{ k_{h} } }$$

#### Note
If a substance on dissolving in water produces two reactions forming $\ce{ H+ }$ and $\ce{ OH- }$ both, then, 
1. Both the reactions will be pulled in the forward direction. 
2. Extent of both reaction are taken equal. However they differ by a small amount. 
3. pH of such solution does not depend on concentration. 

Example of such case are salt of WA-WB, salt containing amphiprotic anion and [[04 Amino Acids]] (Zwitter ions)

#### Why approximate $h_{1} = h_{2}$?
$$\ce{ B+ + H_{2}O <=> BOH + H+, k_{h_{1}} = \frac{ k_{w} }{ k_{b(BOH)} } }$$
$$\ce{ A- + H_{2}O <=> HA + OH-, k_{h_{2}} = \frac{ k_{w} }{ k_{a(HA)} } }$$
Now, the products react to form water,
$$\ce{ H+ + OH- -> H_{2}O }$$
Due to this the concentration of one of the products is decreased and thus the reaction moves forward in both the cases. 

Say, if $k_{h_{1}} > k_{h_{2}}$, then HA is a weak electrolyte and is affected more by the effect of reaction $\ce{ H+, OH- }$. 

Now, $k_{h_{1}} > k_{h_{2}} \implies h_{1} > h_{2}$, but due to the second reaction being more affected by the effect of $\ce{ H+, OH- }$ reacting, $h_{2}$ becomes nearly equal to $h_{1}$ and  thus we can take $h_{1} \approx h_{2}$.  

#### pH 
For pH, we assume,
$$\ce{ [BOH] = [HA] }$$
$$\ce{ [B+] = [A-] }$$

Giving.
$$\frac{ k_{w} }{ k_{a} \times k_{b} } = \ce{ \frac{ [HA]^{2} }{ [A-]^{2} } }$$
We know that, from the reaction,
$$\ce{ HA <=> H+ + A- }$$
$$k_{a} = \ce{ \frac{ [H+] [A-] }{ [HA] } }$$
$$\ce{ \frac{ [HA] }{ [A-] } = \frac{ [H+] }{ k_{a} } }$$

Putting this in the expression,
$$\frac{ k_{w} }{ k_{a} \times k_{b} } = \ce{ \frac{ [H+]^{2} }{ k_{a}^{2} } }$$
$$\ce{ [H+] = \sqrt{ \frac{ k_{a} \times k_{w} }{ k_{b} } } }$$
Thus pH,
$$\ce{ pH = 1/2(pk_{w} + pk_{a} - pk_{b}) }$$
note here that there is no approximations such as $h \leq 0.1$ required. And pH is independent of concentration of salt solution.
