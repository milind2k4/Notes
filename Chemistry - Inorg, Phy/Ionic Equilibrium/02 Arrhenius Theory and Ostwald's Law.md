# Arrhenius Theory of Ionisation
When an electrolyte is dissolved in solvent (water) there exists a dynamic equilibrium between ions and unionised electrolyte. 

E.g. 
$$\ce{ AB {}_{(aq)} <=> A+ + B-, k_{dis} = \frac{ [A+][B-] }{ [AB] } }$$

Finally, dissociation constant comes out to be,
$$k_{d} = \frac{ c \alpha^{2} }{ 1-\alpha }$$

#### Factors Affecting Degree of Ionisation 
1. **Nature of Electrolyte:** DoI is nearly 1 for strong electrolyte, and much less than 1 for weak electrolyte. 
1. **Nature of Solvent:** higher is the value of dielectric constant of solvent, greater will be DoI. 
   Water has high dielectric constant and thus it is one of the best solvent for electrolytes.
   
   Since D is higher for water, the interionic forces,
   $$F = \frac{ kq_{1}q_{2} }{ Dr^{2} }$$
   are less and thus they separate easily. 
   
3. **Concentration of Solution:** Ostwald's Dilution Law
4. **Temperature:**  for endothermic dissolution, increasing T increases DoI, for exothermic dissolution, increasing T decreases DoI. 
   
   Dissolution of most electrolytes in water is endothermic, and hence DoI increases on increasing T. 

5. **Common Ion Effect:** DoI of a weak electrolyte is supressed or decreased in presence of common Ion.
   
   CIE is only applicable for weak electrolyte. 
   
   For example if Acetic Acid is present in the solution,
	$$\ce{ CH_{3}COOH <=> CH_{3}COO- + H+ }$$
	with $\displaystyle \ce{ k_{a} = \frac{ [CH_{3}COO-] [H+] }{ [CH_{3}COOH] } }$
	
	Now if HCl gas is passed into this solution,
	$$\ce{ HCl <=> H+ + Cl- }$$
	Thus the concentration of one of the products, here $\ce{ H+ }$ is increased and thus according to [[05 Le Chatilier's Principle]], equilibrium shifts backwards and the DI of $\ce{ CH_{3}COOH }$ is decreased. 
	
	(here we have added a gas which does not change the volume of the solution to any considerable degree)
	
## Ostwald Dilution Law
Effect of Concentration Variation on $\alpha$ for weak electrolyte. 

We have,
$$k_{d} = \frac{ c\alpha^{2} }{ 1-\alpha }$$

For a weak electrolyte, at moderate to high concentration, $\alpha \ll 1$ and we can take $1 - \alpha \approx 1$
Thus,
$$k_{d} = c\alpha^{2}$$

Now concentration, 
$$c = \frac{ n }{ V }$$
where n is moles of electrolyte and V is solution volume also called **Dilution.** 

Thus,
$$c \propto \frac{ 1 }{ \text{dilution} (V) }$$

This the equation becomes,
$$\alpha = \sqrt{ \frac{k_{dis}}{c} }$$
$$\alpha \propto \frac{ 1 }{ \sqrt{ c } }$$
$$\alpha \propto \sqrt{ \text{dilution} }$$

Thus, **for weak electrolyte, decreasing concentration or increasing dilution, DoI increases.** 

Now,
$$k_{d} = \frac{ c\alpha^{2} }{ 1-\alpha }$$
$$c\alpha^{2} + k_{d}\alpha - k_{d} = 0$$
Here, as c $\to 0$, $\alpha \to 1$, i.e. a weak electrolyte starts behaving like a strong electrolyte when solution is extremely dilute. 

Such dilute solution where $\alpha \to 1$ is called **Infinitely Dilution Solution.**
