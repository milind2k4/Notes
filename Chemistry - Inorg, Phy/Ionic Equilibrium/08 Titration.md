# Titration
It is an experimental process of determining concentration of a solution with the help of standard solution using a suitable indicator. 

*Standard solution* is one whose concentration is previously known. This is also called titrant and is added drop by drop by a burette. 

The solution of which concentration is to be found is called *analyte.* 

We also add an *indicator* which changes colour sharply when the reaction is complete. 

*Equivalence point* is the theoretical point at which reaction is completed.
*End point* is the experimental point at which indicator shows sharp colour change.
These two should be as close as possible for accurate titration.

For example in the reaction,
$$\ce{ CH_{4}COOH + NaOH -> CH_{3}COONa + H_{2}O }$$
Equivalence  point is when $\ce{ CH_{3}COOH }$ is completely reacted by NaOH.

Half equivalence point is when half of the reacted has reacted and rest half is remaining. 

Using that logic, 1/5th equivalence point will be when 1/5th is reacted and 4/5th is remaining. 

#### Indicator 
They are substance added in small amount into analyte solution to detect equivalence point by sharp colour change. 

Indicators used in acid base titration are either weak organic acid or weak organic base. 

Phenolphthalein (HPh) is a weak organic acid whereas Methyl Orange (MeOH or MOH) is a weak organic base which are commonly used as indicator in acid base titrations. 

These indicators show different colours due to their ionised or unionised form. 

**HPh** is *colourless in unionised* form and *pink in ionised* form. 
**MOH** is *yellow in unionised* form and *red in ionised * form. 

This colour change is due to structure change.

Unionised form is called Benzanoid form and Ionised form is called Quinonoid. 

### Theory of Indicators 
For an acidic indicator, represented by $\ce{ HIn }$
It has its own equilibrium,
$$\ce{ HIn <=> H+ + In- }$$

This has $\ce{ k_{In} }$,
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
k_{In} &= \frac{ [H+] [In-] }{ [HIn] } \\
[H+] &= k_{In} \frac{ [HIn] }{ [In-] } \\
-\log[H+] &= -\log k_{In} - \log \frac{ [HIn] }{ [In-] } \\
pH &= pk_{In} + \log \frac{ [In-] }{ [HIn] } \\
pH &= pk_{In} + \log \frac{ [ionised] }{ [unionised] }  
 }
\end{split}
$$

At the start when there is no base and only acid, the indicator is not ionised. As we start adding base, $\ce{ H+ }$ is consumed, and the equilibrium of indicator is shifted in the forward direction. 

Ideally, when the ionised form becomes more than 50% (i.e. when $\displaystyle \ce{ \frac{ [In-] }{ [HIn] } = 1 }$), colour changed.

However, human eye is not capable of seeing the colour change for most indicators when the ratio is 1. It is experimentally observed that we see a distinct colour for most indicators when the ratio of concentration of ionised and unionised form either exceeds 10 or is less than 0.1.

For example, in HPh, which has $pk_{In} = 9$
If $\ce{ \frac{ [In-] }{ [HIn] } = 10 }$ or more, then ionised form is dominant and pink colour is visible. And pH becomes,
$$\ce{ pH = pk_{In} + 1 }$$


If $\ce{ \frac{ [In-] }{ [HIn] } = 0.1 }$ or less, then unionised form is dominant and no colour is visible. And pH becomes,
$$\ce{ pH = pk_{In} - 1 }$$

For most indicators the transition range is 2 units.

### Selection of Indicators
pH changes very sharply near the equivalence point in most of the acid base titrations (by many units).

A suitable indicator is one whose pH transition range lies in steep section of titration curve (near the equivalence point).
I.e. the steep section of titration curve in acid base titration near the equivalence point should encompass or cover up the pH transition range of indicator. 

Titration curve is the graph between pH and volume of titrant.

Any one of the three here will suitable. The most suitable one is the one whose $\ce{ pk_{In} }$ is closest to the pH equivalence point of acid base titration. 

Thus here, Bromothymol blue is the best indicator.
