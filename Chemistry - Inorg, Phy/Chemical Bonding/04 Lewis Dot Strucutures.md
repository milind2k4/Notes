# Lewis Dot Structure
It represents connectivity of various elements in given compound and also the account of valence e in terms of bonds and non-bonded e. 

Covalent bond are shown by dash and valence e by dots. 

LDS does not provide any info. about shape or geometry of molecule. 

### Drawing LDS
For poly atomic molecules or species. 

1. Identify the central atom. Central atom is usually low EN, and covalency more than 1. *H and F are almost always terminal atoms.* There may be more than one central atoms. 
$\\$

3. Guess the skeleton of species. Generally symmetrical structure is the most common one. However, it has to be verified experimentally. 
$\\$

4. Count the total number of valence e, and distribute one pair of e between the atom pairs involving central atom. 
$\\$

5. Complete the octet (or doublet in case of H) of terminal atoms. 
$\\$

6. Place remaining e if any on central atom. Complete the octet of CA with available e, if not available then form multiple bonds using non bonded e of terminal atoms. 
\
	For example,
	$$\ce{ :::O-C-O::: -> ::O=C=O:: }$$
	the dots represent the valence e on O.
$\\$

6. Out of various possible LDS, the one in which formal charges on various atoms are closes to zero is the most stable and most plausible structure.

	In most suitable LDS, central atom may have incomplete or expanded octet. However, expanded octet is only possible in case of 3rd or higher period elements. A max. of 4 bonds can be made by 2nd period elements, as they only have 4 orbitals in their valence shell.

For example, nitric acid,

In LDS we do not show Coordinate bonds. 

There are however, exceptions in these guidelines,

#### Formal Charge
FC on an atom in a given species = 
no. of valence e on element - 1/2 \[no. of e involved in bond formation\] - no. of non-bonded e

Summation of FC of the atoms of a species is equal to the total charge on the species. 

Formal charge may be actual charge also. 

Generally, -ve charge resides on more EN atom.
