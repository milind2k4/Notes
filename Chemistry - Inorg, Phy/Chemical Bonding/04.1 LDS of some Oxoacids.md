# Lewis Dot Structures of some important Oxyacids 
#structures
Oxyacid is when H is connected to O which is in turn connected to some other EN element. 

There is nomenclature in oxoacids. 
- Adding one O makes it**Per=**
- Normal is **=ous**
- Removing one O makes it **-ous**
- Removing two O makes is **Hypo- ... -ous**

In writing names for ions,
- Removing H from -ic acid makes it **-ate ion**
- Removing H from -ous acid makes it **-ite ion**

Structure is based on ON central atom, particularly for multiple central atoms.

There are some guidlines, (X is central atom)
- if calculated ON of CA < max. ON, then $\ce{ X-X }$ bond. 
- if calculated ON of CA = max. ON then $\ce{ X-O-X }$ bond. 
- if calculated ON of CA > max. ON then $\ce{ X-O-O-X }$ bond or $\ce{ X-O-O^{-} }$ (peroxy linkage). 

Except an oxyacid of P($\ce{  }$), this is always valid. 

First make structure of oxyanion. Then stick H at the O which has -ve charge.
