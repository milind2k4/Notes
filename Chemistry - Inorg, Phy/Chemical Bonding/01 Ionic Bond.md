# Ionic Bond
They are the electrostatic force of attraction between cations and anions occupying lattice points in crystal structure.

They are generally formed  by losing or gaining of e between metals and non metals. 

E.g.,
$$\ce{ NaCl, KBr, Na_{2}CO_{3}, Ba(NO_{3})2, etc. }$$

##### Favourable Conditions
for formation of ionic bond

1. One of the element should be highly electropositive (metals) and the other should be highly electronegative (non-metals).
2. EN difference should be high.
3. Lattice energy should be high. 

##### General Properties

1. **Direction:** Ionic bond is non directional. In ionic solid, every ion has identical surroundings. 
$\\$

1. **mp & bp:** Due to strong nature of ionic bond, ionic solids have very high mp and bp. (mp of NaCl is 800 C)
$\\$

1. **Physically:** They are hard and brittle. 
$\\$

1. **Solubility:** Ionic compounds are highly soluble in polar solvents like water, as ionic compounds are highly polar. 

	Due to their polarity they are well soluble in polar solvents which have high dielectric constant like water (water has dielectric constant of nearly 80).

	Dielectric constant $\uparrow \implies$solubility of ionic compounds $\uparrow$.

	Also, non polar molecules (like hydrocarbons) are better soluble in non-polar solvents like $\ce{ CCl_{4}, C_{6}H_{6}, Cs_{2} }$ etc.

1. **Conductivity:** Ionic compounds conduct electricity in molten and aq. solution phase. 
$\\$

1. **Reactivity:** Reactions involving ionic compounds are very fast in solution phase. 
$\\$

1. **Isomerism:** Ionic compounds don't show isomerism, rather ionic compounds may show *polymorphism* or *isomorphism*.
   
	- **Polymorphism:** when an ionic compound exists in different crystal structures. e.g. $\ce{ ZnS }$ is found as Zinc Blend (cubic) and Wurtzite (hexagonal)
	- **Isomorphism:** when different ionic compounds show similar crystal structures. The compounds are called *isomorphs*. e.g. $\ce{ \underset{ green vitriol }{ FeSO_{4}. 7H_{2}O }, \underset{ epsom salt }{ MgSO_{4}.7H_{2}O } \& \underset{ white vitriol }{ ZnSO_{4}.7H_{2}O } }$

		(Sulphate containing compounds is called *vitriol* and $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$ is called *oil of vitriol*)

#### Electrovalency 
It is the number of e lost or gained. by an element in ionic compound. 

It is just a number and is not +ve or -ve.
