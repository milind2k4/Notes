# Chemical Bonding
Chemical bond is the attractive force between the constituent particles in a compound. 

When a chemical bond is formed, the energy of the constituent particles 

There are two types of Chemical Bond, 
1. **Primary:**
	1. *Covalent Bond /Coordinate Bond ($\ce{ e^{ -ve }-e^{ -ve } }$)* which is formed by sharing of electrons
	2. *Ionic Bond ($\ce{ e^{ +ve }-e^{ -ve } }$)* which is formed by complete transfer of e
	4. *Metallic Bond ($\ce{ e^{ +ve }-e^{ +ve } }$)* which is formed using the band model.

Covalent bonds and Coordinate bonds are the same property wise.
A single covalent bond contains 2 e.

When two combining atoms approach each other to form chemical bond, PE of decreases and hence stability increases.

($r_{o}$ is bond length. the energy 432 kJ/mol is released during bond formation)

**Bond Energy** is the energy released during formation of bond. 

3rd or higher period elements can expand their octet, but 2nd period cannot.
This is because 2nd period elements only have 2s and 2p orbitals.

### Dipole Moment 
$$\mu = \delta \times d$$
where,
$\delta \to$ charge
$d \to$ bond length

$\mu$ is a vector quantity, where the vector points towards the more electronegative atom.
Its unit Coulombs-meter or more commonly used, Debye (D).

$$1\ D = \frac{1}{3} \times 10^{-29}\ \ce{ Cm }\ or\ 10^{-18}\ \ce{ esu-cm }$$

$$\ce{ 1 e- charge = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} C = 4.8 \times 10^{-10} esu }$$

In general, $\Delta EN \uparrow\implies \delta \uparrow \implies \implies \mu \uparrow$

In a polyatomic molecule, we add the dipole moments of each bond vectorially. 

An exception is, #important 
$$\ce{ C-F < C-Cl }$$
this is due to dominant bond length. 

Lone pair also contributes in net dipole moment, its direction is taken away from the atom bearing it. However, we cannot mathematically calculate it. 

$$\ce{ NH_{3} > NF_{3} }$$
$\mu_{net}$ of $\ce{ NH_{3} }$ is much much higher than that of $\ce{ NF_{3} }$
This is due to the presence of lp on then N atom.

On the basis of $\mu$ we qualify molecules as polar if $\mu \neq 0$ and non-polar if $\mu = 0$. 
If the molecule is symmetrical then the vector sum is zero, and thus $\mu_{net}$ is zero. If the molecule is polar then the molecule is unsymmetrical.

Some trends of $\mu$,
$$\ce{ HF > HCl > HBr > HI }$$
$$\ce{ H_{2}O > H_{2}S }$$
$$\ce{ CH_{3}Cl> CH_{2}Cl_{2} > CHCl_{3} > CCl_{4} }$$
$$\ce{ o-isomer > m-isomer > p-isomer }$$

However in di-phenol, p-isomer is not non-polar, because the lone pairs are not symmetrically oriented,

$$\ce{ CD_{3}Cl > CH_{3}Cl }$$
![[Pasted image 20230605220304.png]]
this concludes that D is less EN than H

$$\ce{ CH_{3}Cl > CH_{3}F }$$

Due to polarity, a % ionic character is introduced, it is,
$$\% \text{ ionic character} = \frac{ \mu_{obs} }{ \mu_{theo} } \times 100$$
$\mu_{theo}$ is theoretical dipole moment taking 100% ionic bond.

$$\% \text{ ionic character} = \frac{ \delta \times BL }{ 1 e \times BL } \times 100$$
this 1 e charge can be 2, 3, 4 e also. The e charge should be in esu and the bond length in cm. 

## Intermolecular Forces
r is internuclear distance. 

1. **Ion-Dipole** attraction
	   - PE $\propto \displaystyle \frac{1}{r^{2}}$
	$\\$

2. **Dipole-Dipole** attraction 
	- [[12 Hydrogen Bonding|Hydrogen Bonding]] is a special type of Dipole-Dipole interaction. 
	- PE $\propto \displaystyle \frac{1}{r^{3}}$
	$\\$

3. **Ion-induced Dipole** attraction: Between ion and non-polar molecules.
  ![[Pasted image 20230606212451.png]]
	- PE $\propto \displaystyle \frac{1}{r^{4}}$\
	$\\$

4. **Dipole-induced Dipole** attraction: Between polar and non-polar molecules.
   ![[Pasted image 20230606212543.png]]
	- PE $\propto \displaystyle \frac{1}{r^{6}}$
	$\\$

5.  **London Dispersion force** (or *Instantaneous dipole-induced dipole* attraction):  Between non-polar non-polar molecules. 
	- Responsible for interactions in non-polar molecules and describes bp, $\Delta H_{vap}$ etc properties in non-polar molecules. 
	- However, these always accompany other types of interactions e.g. covalent, ionic, H bonds. They are present everywhere. 
	- It occurs when there is disturbance in the e cloud.  
			![[Pasted image 20230606213001.png]]
	
	- PE $\propto \displaystyle \frac{1}{r^{6}}$
	- In general, Molar mass $\uparrow\implies$ London Force $\uparrow$
		- bp: $\ce{ F_{2} < Cl_{2} < Br_{2} I_{2} }$
		- bp: $\ce{ He < Ne < Ar < Kr < Xe }$
		- exception: $\ce{ H_{2} > He }$, because polarization of e in $\ce{ H_{2} }$ is greater than in He.
