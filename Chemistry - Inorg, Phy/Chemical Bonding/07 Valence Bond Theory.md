# Valance Bond Theory
Overlapping of appropriately oriented atomic orbitals form covalent/coordination bond. 

Extent of overlapping $\uparrow \implies$   bond strength $\uparrow$
Bond is only formed when same sign of the wave functions overlap.

Covalent bond forms between atomic orbitals which are half filled. 
Coordinate bond forms between overlapping of a vacant and fully filled orbitals. 

One of the overlapping orbitals will have spin up e, and the other will have spin down. The e can change their spin when needed. 

Two types of overlapping:

#### Head-on Overlapping (Axial Overlap)
$\sigma$ bond is formed. (it is stronger than $\pi$ bond)
Between two atoms the first bond is $\sigma$ and then the subsequent bonds are $\pi$. 
Shape of the compound is determined by sigma bonds. 
It is a strong bond as it increases the e density between the nuclei, and intersects the internuclear axis.

$s$ orbitals only form $\sigma$ bonds.

if z axis is the internuclear axis, then $p_{z}$ forms $\sigma$ bond while $p_{x}$ and $p_{y}$ form $\pi$ bonds. 

#### Sideways Overlapping (Lateral Overlap)
$\pi$ bond is formed. 
Overlapping e could does not intersect the internuclear axis, rather it is parallel to it.
They are easily delocalised. 

p and d orbitals usually form pi-bonds.

## Bond Formation

Bond formation, a/c to VBT, occurs doe to +ve overlapping. Zero overlapping or -ve overlapping does not result in bond formation. 

1. **Positive Overlapping:** when orbitals of same sign wave functions of combining atoms overlap in proper orientation. Constructive.

2. **Negative Overlapping:** when orbitals of opposite sign wave functions overlap. Destructive interference.

3. **Zero Overlapping:** no net increase in e density between the nuclei of combining atom. The negative overlap neutralizes the effect of positive overlap.

	If z-axis is internuclear axis, then $s + p_{z}$ will form sigma bond provided +ve overlapping occurs. 
	$s + p_{x}\ or\ p_{y}$ means zero overlap.
	
	Zero overlapping can also occur with $p_{x} + p_{y}$ orbitals also,

Thus if z axis is internuclear axis,
$$
\begin{split}
s + p_{z} &= \sigma \\
p_{z} + p_{z} &= \sigma\\
p_{x} + p_{x} &= \pi \\
p_{y} + p_{y} &= \pi
\end{split}
$$
provided +ve overlapping.

And in all other cases, no bond is formed. 

Overlapping of one lobe each = $\sigma$ 
Overlapping of two lobe each = $\pi$ 
Overlapping of four (d & f-orbials only) lobes each = $\delta$

Taking z-axis as internuclear axis,
$$
\begin{split}
d_{z^{2}} + s/p_{z} / d_{z^{2}} &= \sigma \\
d_{xz} + p_{x} / d_{xz} &= \pi \\
d_{yz} + p_{y} / d_{yz} &= \pi \\
d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} + d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} &= \delta \\
d_{xy} + d_{xy} &= \delta 
\end{split}
$$

$\delta$ bond is formed between metal atoms in compounds like $\ce{ Re_{2}Cl_{8}^{2-}, Mo_{2}Cl_{8} }^{4-}$ etc. These compounds are called **Metal Clusters.**

### Order of Bond formation and Shape
First bond formed is sigma and then the subsequent bond formed are pi bonds. If single bond is formed, then it will be sigma. If double then one sigma and one pi. If triple then one sigma and two pi.

Shape of molecule is decided by sigma bonds. Pi bonds have no role in the shape of molecule. 

There is a free rotation about sigma bond, but no free rotation about double or pi bonds. Because of this we have geometrical isomers. 

Compounds having pi bonds are generally more reactive because pi bond is weaker than sigma, and thus can be broken easily. 

Since pi bond is weak, it can be easily delocalised giving rise to Resonance.

### Molecule Formation
VBT explains diatomic molecules sufficiently well.

## Failure of VBT
In case of multi atomic species, $\ce{ CH_{4} }$ for example,

![[Pasted image 20230522205820.png]]

According to VBT, $\ce{ CH_{4} }$ is expected to have 3 C-H bonds oriented at 90 degrees and also one C-H bond having different bond energy than the rest 3 C-H bonds. 

However, experimentally it was found that all 4 C-H bonds in methane are of equal bond energy and also all the bond angles are the same, each being $109^{\circ} 28'$. None of the bond angles are 90 degrees. 

Thus, VBT explains the formation of diatomic molecules satisfactorily, but fails to explain the geometry and bond properties of polyatomic molecules. 

To explain bond properties and shape of polyatomic molecules, a hypothetical concept of [[08 Hybridisation|hybridisation]] is adopted which along with VBT, makes more complete theory for polyatomic molecules.
