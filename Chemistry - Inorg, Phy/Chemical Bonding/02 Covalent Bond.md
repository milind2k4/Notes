# Covalent Bond
Bond formed by sharing of one, two or three pairs of e between combining atoms. Electronic cloud of shared pair(s) is shared by both the atoms.

##### Coordinate Bond
(aka **Dative Bond**)

It is formed by unequal sharing of a pair of e. One atom donates the pair of e (called *donor*) and another atom accepts the pair of e (called *acceptor*).

These bond are generally shown by an arrow from donor to acceptor ($\ce{ -> }$)

(here ammonia is called donor and boron trichloride is acceptor)

Property wise, coordinate bonds are no different from covalent bonds. Thus, after formation of molecule, we cannot tell which bond is covalent. 

For example in ammonium ion, all 4 N-H bond are experimentally found to be identical w.r.t bond energy and bond length.

##### Favourable Conditions
for the formation of covalent bond

1. IE of combining atoms should be high so that cation does not form. Thus they are generally formed between non-metals.
1. EN difference should be small or high. 

##### General Properties

1. **Direction:** Covalent bond is directional as it is formed by overlapping of directional orbitals. Due to this covalent molecules have a definite geometry, like tetrahedral, octahedral etc.
$\\$

2. **mp & bp:** In general mp and bp of covalent compounds are low, due to weak Van der Waal's forces between covalent molecules. Few covalent compounds have exceptionally high mp and bp like diamond, graphite, silica etc. 
$\\$

3. **Conductivity:** In general, covalent compounds are bad conductors of electricity. Except graphite which is a good conductor of electricity along the sheet. 
$\\$

4. **Solubility:** Covalent compounds are highly soluble in non polar solvents like benzene.
$\\$

5. **Isomerism:** They may show isomerism. 
$\\$

1. **Reactivity:** Reactions involving them are slow because some of the bond need to be broken in reactants which is a time taking process. 

#### Covalency
The number of covalent bonds formed by an atom in a molecule. It is found using structure diagrams. 
Same as "valency".
