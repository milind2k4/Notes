# Hydrogen Bonding
It is a special type of dipole dipole attraction in which one of the poles is H attached covalently to small sized EN atom like F, O, N.

It is the interaction between partial +vely charged H and lp of H-bonded EN atom.  The EN atom donated its lp to the +vely charged H.

E.g. $\ce{ HF, H_{2}O }$

In general, bond energy of covalent bond is 200 to 450 kJ/mol, and that of H-Bond is 8-40 kJ/mol. Thus, usually, H-bond is much weaker than a covalent bond. 
However, $\ce{ HF_{2}- }$ has H-bond is very strong, it has bond energy nearly 161.5 kJ/mol. Thus it is as strong as covalent bond.

However, $\ce{ KHCl_{2} }$ does not exist.

Strength of H-bond depends on,
1. $\Delta EN$ of covalently bonded H and the other atom. *(dominating factor)*
2. Ease with which lp is donated by EN atom to H-bonded H atom. The order is, $\ce{ N > O > F }$.

Solids have more H bonding than liquid than in gas, 
$$\text{solid > liquid > gas}$$

## Types of H-bonding
### Intermolecular 
When 2 or more molecules are connected through H-bonding.

$\ce{ CH_{3}COOH }$ forms dimer in benzene solvent.

In water, it dissociates, into ions,
$$\ce{ CH_{3}COOH <->[H_{2}O] CH_{3}COO- + H+ }$$

$\ce{ HF{}_{(s)} }$ has H-bonded zig-zag type chain structure.

Boric acid, $\ce{ H_{2}BO_{3} {}_{(s)} }$ is H-bonded sheet like structure. 
![[Pasted image 20230606204822.png]]

In $\ce{ NaHCO_{3} }$ units are attached through H-bonding to form chain like structure, and in $\ce{ KHCO_{3} }$ two molecules of $\ce{ HCO_{3}- }$ are attached through H bonding to form dimer.

#### H bonding in water
H-bonded cage like structure of Ice,
![[Pasted image 20230606203304.png]]

It is a 3D cage like tetrahedral structure like diamond. Due to this cavities are formed which decrease its density, the reason why ice floats on liquid water. When ice is heated, H-bonds partially break and number of cavities decrease and hence density increases and reaches max at $4^{\circ}C$.

Further heating causes thermal expansion and the density decreases. 

Also, $\ce{ D_{2}O {}_{(s)} }$ sinks in $\ce{ H_{2}O {}_{(l)} }$ but floats on $\ce{ D_{2}O {}_{(l)} }$. This is due to EN of D being less than that of H, $\ce{ EN_{D} < EN_{H} }$. Thus $\ce{ D_{2}O }$ forms stronger H-bonds than H and hence the density is more. 

Appropriately sized molecules/atoms like $\ce{ Br_{2}, Cl_{2}, Xe, Kr }$ get trapped mechanically in the cavities of ice or solid quinols $\ce{ (OH-Ph-OH) }$, this arrangement is called **Clathrates**.  The molecules which get trapped have size similar to the cavity.  

### Intramolecular
When H-bond is within the molecule. 

Generally, ortho isomers of benzene derivatives show intramolecular H-bonding,

meta and para isomers do not form intramolecular H-Bond, but they do show intermolecular H-bonding.
![[Pasted image 20230606205428.png]]

Chloral Hydrate, $\ce{ CCl_{3}CH(OH)2 }$ has two intramolecular H-bonds per molecule.

### Effects of H-bonding 
Intermolecular H-bonding increases,
1. bp (decreases volatility)
2. viscosity 
3. solubility in water
4. $\Delta H_{vap}$ (energy needed )

The effect of intramolecular H-bonding is **opposite** to that of Intermolecular H-bonding. This is because since the molecules themselves have H-bonding, they do not attract other molecules. 

Some orders of bp,
$$\ce{ \underbrace{ HF }_{  } > HI > HBr > HCl }$$
$$\ce{ \underbrace{ H_{2}O }_{  } > H_{2}Te > H_{2}Se > H_{2}S }$$
$$\ce{ SbH_{3} > \underbrace{ NH_{3} }_{  } > AsH_{3} > PH_{3} }$$
in general, bp is directly proportional to molar mass.

The underbraced ones have H-bonding, thus their anomalous behaviour

 The H-bonding in $\ce{ NH_{3} }$ is less than that of $\ce{ SbH_{3} }$ because the extent of H bonding in it is less and thus the mass of $\ce{ SbH_{3} }$ is dominating factor. 

bp order among organic compounds,
carboxylic acids > alcohols > aldehydes,

Carboxylic acids have greater extent of H bonding than alcohols and aldehydes do not have H bonding as the EN difference of C and H is not much. 

Wood contains cellulose having O atoms that form H bond with water of ice cream, due to which the stick sticks to the ice cream. This is why in ice creams, wooden sticks are used instead of plastic.
