### Types of Hybridisation and Geometry

| SN  | Hybridised Orbitals |           Participating Orbitals           | Geometry                      |
|:---:|:-------------------:|:------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------- |
|  2  |        $sp$         |              $s + p_{(any)}$               | Linear                        |
|  3  |      $sp^{2}$       |            $s + p_{x} + p_{y}$             | Trigonal Planar               |
|  4  |      $sp^{3}$       |                $s + p^{3}$                 | Tetrahedral                   |
|  4  |      $dsp^{2}$      |       $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} + s + p^{3}$        | Square Planar                 |
|  5  |      $sp^{3}d$      |          $s + p^{3} + d_{z^{2}}$           | Trigonal Bipyramidal          |
|  6  |    $sp^{3}d^{2}$    | $s + p^{3} + d_{z^{2}} + d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$  | Octahedral or Sq. Bipyramidal |
|  7  |    $sp^{3}d^{3}$    | $s+p^{3}+d_{z^{2}}+d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}+d_{xy}$ | Pentagonal Bipyramidal        |

s and p orbitals are of valence shell, and the d orbitals are of penultimate shell. 

Due to lone pair these geometries get disturbed. If there is a lp then all the bond angles are less than usual. 


### Shape of Orbitals

Formed HOs orient themselves in space in such a way that the distance is max. and hence repulsion is min. 
Hybrid orbitals are equivalent, if they face similar repulsions. 
**Axial** orbitals are those which are not in the plane. 
**Equatorial** orbitals are those which are in the plane. 
   
- In trigonal bipyramidal, each axial HO faces 3 repulsions at 90 and one repulsion at 180. Each equatorial HO faces, 2 repulsions at 90 and 2 repulsions at 120 degree. This means that all the 5 HOs are not equivalent.
$\\$

- In Octahedral, each equatorial orbital faces 4 repulsions at 90 and 1 at 180. Each axial orbital faces 4 at 90 and 1 at 180. Thus all 6 HO are equivalent. 
$\\$

- In Pentagonal bipyramidal, each equatorial orbital faces 2 repulsions at 90, 2 at 72 and 2 at 144. Each axial orbital faces 5 repulsions at 90 and one at 180. Thus all the 7 HOs are not equivalent. 


Lone pair and odd e on central atom are not visualised in actual shape of the molecule. The shape of a covalent molecule is decided by bond pairs only. Presence of lone pairs or odd e may distort the ideal geometry of the molecule. 
   
   **e-Pair Geometry** means the shape of the molecule when the lone pair is considered another bond. 
   **Shape** means the shape formed by only bonds. 

[[10 VSEPR Theory|VSEPR theory]], on this basis, builds on hybridisation and predicts the shape of molecules.
