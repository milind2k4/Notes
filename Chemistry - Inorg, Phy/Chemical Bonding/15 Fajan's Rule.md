# Fajan's Rule: Polarization or Distortion in Ionic Bond
Due to distortion of outer e cloud by cation, a covalent character is introduced, this is called **Polarization of e cloud of anion** (Fajan's Rule)

Extent of polarization depends on
1. Polarizing power of cation
2. Polarizability of anion

#### Polarizing power of cation (PP of cation)
It is directly proportional to charge and inversely to size. 

Cations having nearly same size and same charge, the one having pseudo inert config has greater polarizing power, due to greater $Z_{eff}$ which is in turn due to poor shielding caused by d e. 

**Pseudo Inert config:** $\ce{ (n-1)s^{2} (n-1)p^{6} (n-1)d^{10} }$.
E.g. $\ce{ Zn^{2+}, Cd^{2+}, Hg^{2+}, Cu+, Ag+, Au+ }$.

In d block, $Z_{eff}$ increases from Top to Bottom, thus pp,
$$\ce{ Cu+ < Ag+ < Au+ }$$
$$\ce{ Zn^{2+} < Cd^{2+} < Hg^{2+} }$$

Comparing pp among group 1,2 and the d block elements,
$$\ce{ Ca^{2+} < Zn^{2+} }$$
$$\ce{ Na+ < Ag+ }$$

#### Polarizability of Anion 
Ability of an anion to get easily polarised. 

Polarizability is proportional to magnitude of charge and size of atom. 

Thus, order of polarization,
$$\ce{ F- < Cl- < Br- < I- }$$
$$\ce{ O^{2-} < S^{2-} < Se^{2-} }$$
$$\ce{ F- < O^{2-} < N^{3-} }$$

### Applications of Fajan's Rule
1. *Covalent Character in ionic bond:* 
   extent of polarization $\uparrow \implies$ covalent character $\uparrow$
   Order of covalent character,
	$$\ce{ BeCl_{2} > MgCl_{2} > CaCl_{2} > SrCl_{2} > BaCl_{2} }$$
	$$\ce{ LiF > NaF > KF > RbF > CsF }$$
	$$\ce{ LiI > LiBr > LiCl > LiF }$$
	$$\ce{ AlCl_{3} > MgCl_{2} > NaCl }$$
	$$\ce{ Ag_{2}S > Ag_{2}O }$$
	$$\ce{ AgCl > NaCl }$$
	$$\ce{ HgCl_{2} > CaCl_{2} }$$
	$\\$

2. *Thermal Stability of ionic compounds:* 
	covalent character $\uparrow \implies$ thermal stability $\downarrow$
   
	Thermal stability means how hard it is to decompose the compound. I.e. more thermally stable means decomposes are higher temp. 
   
	Order of thermal stability,
	$$\ce{ BeCO_{3} < MgCO_{3} < CaCO_{3} < SrCO_{3} < BaCO_{3} }$$
	$$\ce{ Li_{2}CO_{3} < Na_{2}CO_{3} < K_{2}CO_{3} < Rb_{2}CO_{3} < Cs_{2}CO_{3} }$$
	$\ce{ Li_{2}CO_{3} }$ is thermally unstable and thus decomposes to $\ce{ LiO + CO_{2} }$ but the others do not decompose. 
   
	This applies mainly for polyatomic anions like carbonate, sulphate etc.. 
   
	In case of monoatomic anions, the *polarization is to a very low extent* and thus thermal stability depends on **lattice energy,** which is the energy required to break 1 mol of ionic solid into its constituent gaseous ions. 
	
	The lattice energy depends on separation between the ions and their charges. 
	
	Thus, decreasing order of lattice energy and thus the decreasing order of thermal stability,
	$$\ce{ LiH > NaH > KH > RbH > CsH }$$
	$$\ce{ Li_{2}O > Na_{2}O > K_{2}O }$$
	$\\$

3. Ionic compounds having high extent of polarization and hence high covalent character are found to be deep coloured. 
   e.g. AgCl is white, AgBr is pale yellow and AgI is bright yellow. As we go from Cl to I, the covalent character increases. 
   
   $\ce{ HgCl_{2} }$ is white and $\ce{ HgI_{2} }$ is red.
   $\ce{ Hg_{2}Cl_{2} }$ is white and $\ce{ Hg_{2}I_{2} }$ is green. 
   
   The reason is that the weakly held e cloud of anion by the cation absorbs visible light and hence is found to be coloured.

#### Solubility of Ionic Compound in water
(general guidelines)

It is divided into two parts,

###### Compounds of s-block (except halides of Be)
Solubility depends on relative variation of hydration energy and lattice energy. 
If HE > LE compound will be more soluble in water.

- **Hydration Energy (of ion):** the energy released when an ion in gaseous form is hydrated or dissolved in water.  Energy is always released because the ion has ion-dipole attraction.
  \
	![[Pasted image 20230608210742.png]]
	

	It is directly proportional to magnitude to charge and inversely to size.
	Thus,
	$$\ce{ Li+ > Na+ > K+ > Rb+ > Cs+ }$$
	$$\ce{ Al^{3+} > Mg^{2+} > Na+ }$$
	$$\ce{ F- > Cl- > Br- > I- }$$
	
	The hydrated size is much greater than the size of the gaseous ion. Smaller is the size of gaseous ion, the extent of hydration is more and thus the hydrated size is greater. 
	The more charge a gaseous ion has the greater is the hydrated size. 
	
	$$\ce{ Li+ {}_{(aq)} > Na+ {}_{(aq)} > \dots Cs+ {}_{(aq)} }$$
	$$\ce{ Al^{3+} {}_{(aq)} > Mg^{2+} {}_{(aq)} > Na+ {}_{(aq)} }$$
	$\\$

1. For alkali metal compounds, 
	1. For $\ce{ F-, OH-, CO_{3}^{2-}, HCO_{3}- }$: solubility will increase from top to bottom
			$$\ce{ LiOH < NaOH < KOH < RbOH < CsOH }$$

	2. For other anions ($\ce{ SO_{4}^{2-}, C_{2}O_{2-}, ClO_{4}- }$): solubility will decrease from top to bottom
			$$\ce{ NaClO_{4} > KClO_{4} }$$
	$\\$

2. For compounds of alkaline earth metals, 
	1. For anions $\ce{ F-, OH-, CO_{3}^{2-} }$: solubility increases from top to bottom. #important 
		  $$\ce{ MgF_{2} < CaF_{2} < SrF_{2} < BaF_{2} < \underset{ exception }{ BeF_{2} } }$$
		  $$\ce{ Be(OH)2 < Mg(OH)2 < Ca(OH)2 < Sr(OH)2 < Ba(OH)2 }$$ 
      
	2. For other anions ($\ce{ SO_{4}^{2-}, C_{2}O_{2-}, ClO_{4}- }$): solubility will decrease from top to bottom
		   $$\ce{ BeSO_{4} > MgSO_{4} > CaSO_{4} > SrSO_{4} > BaSO_{4} }$$


##### Compounds of p,d-block (and halides of Be)
Solubility is governed by extent of polarization or covalent character. 

$$\text{solubility in water} \propto \frac{1}{\text{covalent character}}$$

In halides of Be,
$$\ce{ BeF_{2} > BeCl_{2} > BeBr_{2} > BeI_{2} }$$


For halides of other elements,
$$\ce{ AgF > AgCl > AgBr > AgI }$$
$$\ce{ ZnCl_{2} > CdCl_{2} > HgCl_{2} }$$
$$\ce{ PbCl_{2} > PbBr_{2} > PbI_{2} }$$

Comparing with salts of s-block elements,
$$\ce{ NaCl > AgCl }$$
$$\ce{ CaCl_{2} > HgCl_{2} }$$

#### Melting Point of Ionic Compounds
In general, the mp of covalent compounds are lower than that of ionic compounds. 

In general, trends of mp are governed by extent of polarization or Fajan's rule, except in the case of ionic compounds of $\ce{ Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+  }$ (large cations) where pp is very less and extent of polarization is not a deciding factor.  In such cases of large cations, lattice energy is deciding factor. 

Where polarization is dominant, 
$$\text{mp} \propto \frac{ 1 }{ \text{extent of polarization} }$$

Where LE is dominant factor,
$$\text{mp} \propto \text{lattice energy}$$

Thus, some trends are,
$$\ce{ LiF > liCl > LiBr > LiI }$$
$$\ce{ NaCl > MgCl_{2} > AlCl_{3} }$$
$$\ce{ LiCl < NaCl > KCl > RbCl > CsCl }$$
LiCl has lower mp due to high pp of $\ce{ Li+ }$.
