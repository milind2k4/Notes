# Acids and Bases
There are 3 approaches,
1. **Arrhenius Approach**: Substance which gives $\ce{ H+ }$ in water is acid and $\ce{ OH- }$ is base. Thus,
   acids are: $\ce{ HCl, H_{2}So_{4}, HNO_{3}, H_{3}PO_{4}, etc. }$
   bases are: $\ce{ NaOH, KOH, Ba(OH)2, etc. }$
   $\\$

2. **Bronsted Lowry Approach:** Substance which donates $\ce{ H+ }$ is acid and which accepts $\ce{ H+ }$ is base. Here the solvent need not be water. 
   $\\$

3. **Lewis acid-base Approach:** 
   - *Lewis Acid:* which **accepts** lp of e.
	
   - *Lewis Base:* which **donates** lp of e. 
     e.g. $\ce{ X-, NH_{3}, H_{2}O, OH-, etc. }$
     
	For example,

### Types of Lewis Acid
1. **Incomplete octet:** $\ce{ BeF_{2}, BeCl_{2}, BF_{3}, BCl_{3}, AlCl_{3} }$
   $\ce{ BeF_{2} + 2F- -> BeF_{4}^{2-} }$
   $\ce{ BF_{3} + F- -> BF_{4}^{-} }$
	$\\$

2. **Vacant d orbitals:** $\ce{ SiF_{4}, SiCl_{4}, PCl_{5}, BrF_{3}, XeF_{4}, XeF_{6}, etc. }$
   $\ce{ SiF_{4} + 2F- -> SiF_{4}^{2-} }$
   $\ce{ BrF_{3} + F- -> BrF_{4}- }$

   $\ce{ XeF_{4} + F- -> XeF_{5}- }$
   $\ce{ XeF_{6} + F- -> XeF_{7}- }$
   $\\$

3. **Small Sized Cations:** $\ce{ H+, Be^{2+} Mg^{2+}, Li+, Ag+, Co^{2+}, Co^{3+}, Al^{3+} etc. }$
   All cations acts as Lewis acid. 
   $\ce{ H+ + H_{2}O -> H_{3}O+ }$
   $\ce{ Be^{2+} + 4H_{2}O -> [Be(H_{2}O)4]^{2+} }$
   $\\$

4. **Central Atom is Attached to an EN atom through Multiple Bonds:** $\ce{ CO_{2}, SO_{2} etc. }$

5. **Atom that have 6 e in Valence Shell:** $\ce{ O, O_{3} }$

#### Comparison of Strength of LA
Strength of LA (cation) $\propto$ charge
Strength of LA (cation) $\propto \displaystyle \frac{ 1 }{ \text{size} }$
For example, 
$$\ce{ Al_{3}+ > Mg^{2+} > Na+ }$$
$$\ce{ B^{3+} > Be^{2+} > Li+ }$$

Among molecules, smaller is the size of atom accepting lp, greater will be the Lewis acid strength. 
$$\ce{ NaCl < MgCl_{2} < AlCl_{3} }$$
$$\ce{ LiCl < BeCl_{2} < BCl_{3} }$$
$$\ce{ ZnCl_{2} < AlCl_{3} }$$
$$\ce{ SiCl_{4} < PCl_{5} }$$


#### Comparison of Strength of LB
Among hydrides, LB strength decreases as we go along a period or move down a group.
We can also say that in a period, as EN of lp donor atom lowers, LB strength increases. 

This is opposite of [[05 Oxides and Acids#Hydra acids]]

Thus,
$$\ce{ NH_{3} > H_{2}O > HF }$$
as order of EN $\ce{ N < O < F }$
$$\ce{ H_{2}O > H_{2}S }$$
$$\ce{ PH_{3} > H_{2}S > HCl }$$

$$\ce{ NH_{3} > PH_{3} > AsH_{3} > SbH_{3} }$$
as the lp of $\ce{ NH_{3} }$ is better pointed and thus the overlaps better with vacant orbitals, while in $\ce{ PH_{3} }$ the lp is very dispersed and thus does not overlap properly.

### Acidic and Basic Oxides  
Oxides of electronegative elements are acidic. 

Oxides of electropositive elements are basic. 

In d block, the higher is the OS, the more acidic is the corresponding oxide.
