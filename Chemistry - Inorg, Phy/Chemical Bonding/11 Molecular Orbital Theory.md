# Molecular Orbital Theory (MOT)
This is the most advanced theory based on LCAO approach. 

VBT fails to explain formation of $\ce{ O_{2} }$ as VBT predicts it to be diamagnetic, however, experimentally it is found to be paramagnetic with 2 unpaired e. 

MOT also explains formation of molecules like $\ce{ C_{2}, B_{2} etc. }$, which were not explained by VBT. 

### Features
#### Formation of MOs
Appropriate atomic orbitals of combining atoms undergo combination through Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals to form equal number of molecular orbitals (MOs). 
   
Two atomic orbitals of combining atoms combine through LCAO to form one MO with *constructive interference* (in-phase combination) to form **Bonding MO (BMO)** and other MO with *destructive interference* (out of phase combination) to form **Anti-Bonding MO (AMO).**

Energy of BMO is less than that of AOs and hence it is more stable. Energy of AMO is more than that of AOs and thus is less stable. 

If there are 2 wave functions $\psi_{1}$ and $\psi_{2}$, and they undergo constructive interference, they from BMO and the e density is increases,
$$(\psi_{1}+\psi_{2})^{2} = \psi_{1}^{2} + \psi_{2}^{2} + 2\psi_{1}\psi_{2}$$
This $2\psi_{1}\psi_{2}$ is the gain of e density. 

If they undergo destructive interference, the e density is decreased, 
$$(\psi_{1}-\psi_{2})^{2} = \psi_{1}^{2}+\psi_{2}^{2} - 2 \psi_{1}\psi_{2}$$
This $-2\psi_{1}\psi_{2}$ is the loss of e density.

After MOs are formed, existence of involved AOs ceases. MOs are called poly concentric and AOs are called monocentric. 

#### Combination of AOs
AOs taking part in LCAO should have equal or nearly equal energy. 

In homonuclear ($\ce{ O_{2}, Cl_{2}, F_{2}, etc. }$) molecules only the following combinations occur, 
$$
\begin{split}
1s - 1s \\
2s - 2s \\
2p - 2p
\end{split}
$$

However, in heteronuclear $\ce{ CN, NO, NO_{2} etc. }$ molecules, following combinations may occur,
$$
\begin{split}
1s - 1s\\
1s - 2s \\
1s - 2s \\
2s - 2p \\
\text{etc.}
\end{split}
$$

#### Designation of MOs
MOs are designated as $\sigma$ or $\pi$ based on cylindrical symmetry. If MO posses *cylindrical symmetry*, then it is sigma, otherwise pi. 

**Cylindrical Symmetry:** if rotating MO by 180 about its internuclear axis, same sign wave function appears, then it posses cylindrical symmetry. 

**Inversion Line:** a line through centre of MO at 45$^{\circ}$ angle. 

**Gerade MO (g):** in which same sign of wave function appears on moving equal distance from centre on *inversion line.* All sigma BMOs and pi AMOs are gerade.

**Ungerade MO (u):** in which same sign does not occur. All sigma AMOs and pi BMOs are ungerade. 

AMO has one extra nodal plane than BMO.

### Colour and Colourlessness
In general species having 1 or more unpaired e is found to be coloured. And a species with no unpaired e are found to be colourless. 

Actually it is the energy difference between the LUMO and HOMO corresponds to one of the wavelengths of visible region, then the species will be coloured, else coloured. 

This is why $\ce{ F_{2} }$ is coloured as HOMO LUMO energy difference corresbonds to 4000 to 7500 $\dot{A}$ and $\ce{ O_{2} }$ is colourless.
