# Valance Shell Electron Pair Repulsion Theory (VSEPR Theory)
It deals with the repulsions caused by the lp, bp and determines bond angles in molecules.

According to this theory,
lp-lp repulsion > lp-bp repulsion > bp-bp repulsion 

Double bond causes greater repulsion than single bond. And triple bond more than double bond. 

Since lone pair is controlled only by one nucleus, it is larger in size and causes greater repulsions. Thus the bond angles are reduced, for example **in $\ce{ NH_{3} }$, the bond angle is 107 and in $\ce{ H_{2}O }$ it is 104.5.**

Double bond causes greater repulsion than single bond as the electron density is more. 

A is central atom, X is terminal atom, E is lone pair. '--' means "No."

#### Some things to Note
- In Trigonal Bipyramidal geometry lp and double bonds occupy equatorial position, as they experience least repulsions. 
	- It is found that repulsions faced at 90 or less are highly substantial. At 120 and 180, they are not substantial. 
	- From this, we conclude that in TBP equatorial HOs are more stable than axial. 
	- We can think of $sp^{3}d$ as $sp^{2} + pd$, and thus the three equatorial HOs can be considered $sp^{2}$, and axial can be considered $pb$. Thus we can say that greater s character is found in equatorial HOs, and is thus more stable. 
	- lp requires greater s character to get stabilised and hence goes to equatorial position. 
- In Octahedral geometry, all positions are equivalent, thus the lp or double bonds can be placed anywhere. 
- **In PBP, axial position is more stable than equatorial, as it faces less repulsions.** 
	- *In $\ce{ IF_{7} }$, the two axial I-F bonds are shorter and stronger than the 5 equatorial bonds.*  
	- Thus lp and double bond will go to axial position. 

#### Bent's Rule
Less EN atom is diverted to the position which carries greater s-character. However note than lp and double bond occupy equatorial positions in TBP.

More electronegative atom occupies the position which has less $s$ character. I.e. in TBP more electronegative atom (or substituent) occupies axial position.

Axial bond is longer than equatorial. It also has less $s$ character.
Equatorial bonds are stronger and thus shorter than axial. 
In $\ce{ PCl_{5} }$ is is found that the 3 equatorial bonds are stronger and thus shorter, than the axial.

**In $\ce{ PF_{5} }$, all P-F bonds are found to be equivalent in terms of bond length and energy. Axial and equatorial F atoms exchange their positions very quickly.**
