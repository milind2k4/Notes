# Hybridisation

A hypothetical concept in which required number of atomic orbitals of central atom having proper orientation and similar energies undergo intermixing and form equal number of **hybrid orbitals** which form bonds with terminal atoms.

### Postulates
1. Atomic orbitals of central atom undergoing hybridisation should have proper orientation and equal or nearly equal energy. 
   
	In general, s and p -block compounds involve hybridisation of atomic orbitals of valence shell of central atom. 
	$\\$


1. Number of Hybrid orbitals formed are equal to the number of atomic orbitals involved in hybridisation.
$\\$

1. Atomic orbitals taking part in hybridisation may be fully filled, half filled or vacant. 
$\\$

1. Designation of hybridisation, depends on **steric number (SN).**

	**Steric Number:** number of atoms attached to CA + number of lone pairs on CA, from LDS. 

	For example,
	![[Pasted image 20230523193059.png]]
	$\\$


1. Shape or hybrid orbital consists of two unequal sized lobes and the larger is used to overlap and form bond. 
	![[Pasted image 20230523194850.png]]

	The actual shape however, is,
	![[Pasted image 20230523194946.png]]

	HOs form stronger bonds than pure $p$ orbital. Greater is the %s character in the hybrid orbital, greater will be the strength of bond formed.
	$$\underset{ 50\%\ s }{ sp } > \underset{ 33.33\%\ s }{ sp^{2} } > \underset{ 25\%\ s }{ sp^{3} } > \underset{ 0\%\ s }{ p }$$
	decreasing stability of HOs and hence of bond strength 
	
	$$\underset{ \text{increasing size} }{ sp < sp^{2} < sp^{3} }$$
	
	The smaller the orbital, the smaller is the bond formed by overlap and thus stronger is the stronger it is.

### Comparison of Bond angles
According to VSEPR, bond angles in a molecule depends on state of hybridisation, presence of lp(s), type of central atom/terminal atom.

1. **$\%s$ character $\uparrow \implies$ Bond angle $\uparrow$**
    $$\ce{ BeCl_{2} > BCl_{3} > CCl_{4} }$$
    $\\$

2. If hybridisation is the same and terminal atoms are also the same, then **no. of lone pairs $\uparrow \implies$ Bond angle $\downarrow$**
   $$\ce{ NH_{4}+ < NH_{3} < NH_{2}-}$$
   $$\ce{ CH_{2} > NH_{3} > H_{2}O }$$
   
	In absence of lp, and if all terminal atoms  are same then there is no distortion in shape, and thus same bond angles,
	$$\ce{ BF_{3} = BCl_{3} = BBr_{3} = BI_{3}}$$
   $\\$

3. If terminal atoms are the same and lp $\neq 0$ but also the same, then **EN of the CA $\uparrow \implies$ Bond angle $\uparrow$**
   $$\ce{ \underbrace{ NH_{3} }_{ sp^{3} } > \underbrace{ PH_{3} > AsH_{3} > SbH_{3} }_{ \text{No hybridisation} } }$$
   This is because the bp is more shifted towards the CA if it is more EN and thus the bond angles are increased to decrease repulsions. 
   ![[Pasted image 20230530221908.png]]
   
   Similarly for hydrides of O family,
   $$\ce{ \underbrace{ H_{2}O }_{ sp^{3} } > \underbrace{ H_{2}S > H_{2}Se > H_{2}Te }_{ \text{No hybridisation} } }$$
   The no hybridisation is according to Drago's Rule.
   $\\$


4. If terminal atoms are different, and central atom, no. of lone pairs and hybridisation is the same, then, in general, **size of terminal atom $\uparrow \implies$ Bond angle $\uparrow$**
   $$\ce{ COF_{2} < COCl_{2}< COBr_{2} }$$ 
   $$\ce{ OF_{2} < OCl_{2} < OBr_{2} < OI_{2} }$$
   As, larger terminal atoms increase steric repulsion and hence bond angles. 
   
   While comparing H and F as terminal atoms, its EN is the factor that decides bond angle and not size. 
   $$\ce{ H_{2}O > OF_{2} }$$
   as EN of F is more, thus the e cloud shifts outwards in $\ce{ OF_{2} }$.
   ![[Pasted image 20230530223531.png]]
   
   Similarly, 
	$$\ce{ NH_{3} > NF_{3} }$$
	![[Pasted image 20230530223613.png]]
   
   
#### Drago's Rule
There is no hybridisation when 3rd or higher period elements are attached to less EN elements (EN < 2.5, e.g. H, C etc), and bonds are formed by pure p orbitals. 

Due to this bond angles in $\ce{ PH_{3}, AsH_{3}, SbH_{3}, H_{2}S > H_{2}Se > H_{2}Te }$ are nearly 90. 

Similarly, there is no hybridisation in thio-ethers.

### Back Bonding

In $\ce{ BF_{3} }$, B-F bond is found to be stronger than the expected single B-F bond. This is attributed to **$p\pi - p\pi$ back bond** between vacant 2p of B and fully filled 2p of F atom. This bond is delocalised in the entire atom. 

![[Pasted image 20230601213236.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230601213251.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230601213302.png]]

Any pi coordinate bond can be termed as back bond. 

Order of Back bonding, $\ce{ BF_{3} > BCl_{3} > BBr_{3} > BI_{3} }$. This is because the p orbitals of Cl are bigger than that of B and thus  the extent of overlapping is less. 
Thus, $\ce{ BF_{3} < BCl_{3} < BBr_{3} < BI_{3} }$ is the order of Lewis Base strength.

![[Pasted image 20230601213858.png]]

$\ce{ SiH_{4} }$ is called **Silane** and $\ce{ SiH_{2}- }$ is called **Silyl group**. 

Trimethyl amine is pyramidal with $sp^{3}$ N atom. C does not have any vacant orbitals and thus cannot accept the lp of N. 
![[Pasted image 20230601214244.png]]

Trisilyl amine is planar molecule with $sp^{2}$ N atom, due to $p\pi-d\pi$ back bond. 
![[Pasted image 20230601214359.png]]

Whenever Si is attached with N, O etc. $p\pi-d\pi$ back bonding is present. Thus $\ce{ SiO_{2} }$ also has back bond and thus Si-O bond is stronger than expected. 
![[Pasted image 20230601214739.png]]

Disylyl ether also has back bond, and the hybridisation is not $sp^{2}$. Its not $sp^{3}$ either. 
![[Pasted image 20230601214903.png]]

$\ce{ P_{4}O_{10} }$ also has back bond. 
![[Pasted image 20230601215017.png]]


### Banana Bond
**3 Centre - 2 e bond** or **e deficient bond**.
2 e are disturbed between 3 nuclei. 

Diborane: $\ce{ B_{2}H_{6} }$ is a common example of this bond. 
This is one of the special cases where H acts as bridge. 
In this molecule, both B hybridises to $sp^{3}$ but only has 3 e, so one of the hybrid orbitals is empty. 

![[Pasted image 20230601215626.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230601215649.png]]

4 terminal B-H bonds are 2C-2e bond and the two B-H-B bonds are 3C-2e bonds and are called **Banana Bond** or e-deficient bond. The terminal bond angle is more than the bridge bonds.  

![[Pasted image 20230601220107.png]]

$\ce{ B-H-B }$ bond is stronger than the terminal $\ce{ B-H }$ bonds.

Other examples are, $\ce{ (BeH_{2})_{n} or BeH_{2} {}_{(s)}, Al_{2}(CH_{3})_{6},\ Ga_{2}(CH_{3})_{6} }$.

In $\ce{ BeH_{2} }$ adjacent rings are in perpendicular planes. 
![[Pasted image 20230601220344.png]]

In $\ce{ Al_{2}(CH_{3})6 }$, it appears that C has made 5 bonds. but it is not so. Whenever H and alkyl are bridged between two atoms, it forms 3C-2e bonds.

## Formation of Some Molecules by VBT and Hybridisation

The central atom undergoes excitation and hybridisation to form the required number of orbitals. Then the terminal atoms with their e-clouds overlap and form the bonds. 

Most molecules are formed by excitation of central atom. 

VBT + Hybridisation is a more complete theory of molecule formation as most of the molecules predicted by this theory are also experimentally correct. 

Hybrid orbitals form sigma bonds and pure p orbitals form pi bonds. Pi bonds are perpendicular to the e-cloud of sigma bonds.  

The number of bonds is the number of unpaired e required.
