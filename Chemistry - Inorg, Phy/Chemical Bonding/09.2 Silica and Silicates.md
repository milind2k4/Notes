# Silica and Silicates
### Silica ($\ce{ SiO_{2} }$)
It is a covalently bonded network structure like diamond. Due to this, silica has very high mp and bp..

Also silica has 8 membered rings as, (it is 3d ring)

C being small in sized 2nd period element easily makes pi bond by sideways overlapping.
Si atom is larger, and thus the extent of overlapping is low, so it cannot form pi bond using its 3p orbital. So Si in $\ce{ SiO_{2} }$ completes its valency by forming covalently bonded network structure. 

This is the reason why $\ce{ CO_{2} }$ is a gas and $\ce{ SiO_{2} }$ is a high melting solid. 

Thus, increasing tendency to form pi bonds,
$$\ce{ Si < P < S < Cl }$$
And hence, decreasing tendency to form network structure,
$$\ce{ Si > P > S > Cl }$$

### Silicates 
Earth's crust mainly consist of silica and silicates. 

Basic repeating unit of silicates is $\ce{ SiO_{4}^{4-} }$.

There are many types of silicates, 
##### Orthosilicates
No oxygen sharing unit is shared. 

example is Zircon $\ce{ (ZrSiO_{4}) }$, which is a gem stone and appears similar to diamonds,

##### Pyrosilicates
One O of repeating unit is shared. The shared O has no charge. 
The general formula is, $\ce{ Si_{2}O_{7}^{6-} }$

An example will be, $\ce{ Ca_{3}Si_{2}O_{7} }$

##### Chain silicates
Two O are shared. 
The general formula is $\ce{ (SiO_{3})_{n}^{2n-} }$

##### Cyclic Silicates
Two O are shared. 
The formula is $\ce{ (SiO_{3})_{6}^{12-} }$
It forms cyclic structure.

Example is $\ce{ Si_{3}O_{9}^{6-} }$

##### Double chain silicates
aka Amphiboles

3O of repeating unit are shared.
The general formula is $\ce{ (Si_{4}O_{11})_{n}^{6n-} }$

##### Sheet Silicate
3 O of repating unit is shared. 
The general formula is $\ce{ (Si_{2}O_{5})_{n}^{2n-} }$

##### 3D network silicates
All 4 O atoms are shared. 

E.g. Silica.
