# Resonance
Delocalisation of pi e. 

When 2 or more [[04 Lewis Dot Strucutures|LDS]] can be made for a species and non of the LDS are able to explain the bond properties (i.e. length and energy) of species then we say there is resonance. 

All these LDS are called resonating structures or canonical structures. 

Actual molecule or ion is considered a hybrid of all of them and is called *Resonance Hybrid*. In this all the resonating bonds are equal. 

Rules for Resonance,
1. Valid RS should have same connectivity of different atoms. 
2. Total number of lone pair e must be the same. 
3. Total number of unpaired e must same. 

We use $\ce{ <-> }$ to show resonating structures.

(bond order is 1.5 for benzene)

From above RS it appears that 2 different C-C bond lengths are present in benzene. However, it is found experimentally that all the bonds are equivalent and between single and double bonds. Thus the double bonds are uniformly delocalised. 

In case of ozone,

#### Equivalent and Non-Equivalent RS
In general, the one with more formal charge is less stable. And -ve charge is more comfortable on more EN atom of similar size.

#### Bond Order

BO = total no of bonds/total no of atom pairs in which bonds are distributed 

This is only applicable for equivalent RS. 

BO of 1 means single bond. 
BO of 2 means double bond. 
BO of 3 means triple bond. 

BO between 1 and 2 means bond length between single and double.
BO between 2 and 3 means bond length between double and triple.

$$\text{Bond length} \propto \frac{1}{\text{Bond order}}$$

$$\text{Bond strength or Bond energy} \propto \text{Bond order}$$

In, 
![[Pasted image 20230519192327.png]]
Bond order is 4/3. as there are 4 bonds and 3 atom pairs.
