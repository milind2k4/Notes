### Octet Rule 
Elements try to chase octet in valence shell by losing/gaining e or by sharing e so as to become like noble gases. 

Now a days, so many compounds do not follow octet rule and are found to be stable. 

#### Following Octet Rule
$\ce{ H_{2}O,\ NH_{3},\ SF_{2},\ H_{2}S,\ HCl,\ PH_{3},\ CH_{4},\ C_{2}H_{6} }$ etc.

#### Incomplete Octet
$\ce{ NO,\ NO_{2},\ BF_{3},\ BCl_{3},\ AlCl_{3},\ BeCl_{2} }$ etc.
Also called *Hypovalent Molecules*

NO is Nitric Acid. It is paramagnetic. It is a odd e molecule. $\ce{ NO_{2} }$ is also odd e molecule. 

NO and $\ce{ NO_{2} }$ form a dimer on cooling,

#### Expanded Octet
$\ce{ SF_{6},\ IF_{7},\ PCl_{5},\ H_{2}SO_{4},\ SF_{4},\ HClO_{4},\ HClO_{3} }$ etc
Also called *Hypervalent Molecules*

$\ce{ ClO_{2} }$ is an odd e molecule, and is thus paramagnetic. But this does not make dimer. It is believed that the single e is delocalised in the vacant d orbitals.
