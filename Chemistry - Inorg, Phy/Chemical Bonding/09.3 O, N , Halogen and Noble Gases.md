# O, N , Halogen and Noble Gases
### Nitrogen Family Compounds 
$\ce{ NH_{3}, \underset{ amide ion }{ NH_{2}^{-} }, NH_{2}OH, \underset{ hydrazine }{ NH_{2}-NH_{2} } }$
Hydrazine is a rocket fuel. 

**White phosphorous, $\ce{ P_{4} }$,** which is very reactive due to high angle strain as the angle between bonds is 60. It has 6 P-P bonds.

**$\ce{ P_{4}O_{6} }$**
![[Pasted image 20230530200720.png]]

**$\ce{ P_{4}O_{10} }$,** which is a powerful dehydrating substance. The terminal P-O bonds are stronger and shorter than the bridged P-O bonds.

**$\ce{ P_{4}S_{3} }$,** which is used in Matchbox. It has 6 P-S bonds and 3 P-P bonds.

**Phosphonyl Chloride, $\ce{ POCl_{3} }$**

**$\ce{ P_{4}S_{10} }$,** with structure similar to $\ce{ P_{4}O_{10} }$,

### Oxygen Family Compounds
**$\ce{ H_{2}O }$,** with bond angle $104.25^{\circ}$. 

**Hydronium ion, $\ce{ H_{2}O + H+ -> H_{3}O+ }$**

- **Hydrogen Peroxide, $\ce{ H_{2}O_{2} }$** #important
	It has open book like, non-planar structure. 
	In this, O-O bond length is unusually high and thus it decomposes easily, and is an unstable compound. The bond length is high because there are 2 lp on adjacent small sized O atoms.

	- **Bond Length Comparizon:**
		The O-O bond in **$\ce{ O_{2}F_{2} }$** is much shorter but the structure is similar. This is because F is more EN and thus attracts the lp e-cloud.

		Single F-F bond is weaker than single Cl-Cl bond, the order being,
		$$\ce{ Cl-Cl > Br-Br > F-F > I-I }$$
		Similarly, O-O single bond is weaker than S-S single bond and N-N single bond is weaker than P-P single bond. 
		All of this is due to the relative sizes, and due to them, the relative electron density of the lps. 


**$\ce{ S_{8} }$,** with Crown Structure. OS of S is 0 and co-valency is 2.

**$\ce{ SO_{3} }$** exits as solid trimer at room temp. $\ce{ (SO_{3})3 or S_{3}O_{9} or \upgamma-SO_{3} }$. It is a cyclic structure.

**Sulphuryl Chloride, $\ce{ SO_{2}Cl_{2} }$**
![[Pasted image 20230530203827.png]]

**Thionyl Chloride, $\ce{ SOCl_{2} }$**
![[Pasted image 20230530203837.png]]

### Halogens
$\ce{ HClO_{4}, HClO_{3}, HClO }$
![[Pasted image 20230530204054.png]]

### Noble Gases
