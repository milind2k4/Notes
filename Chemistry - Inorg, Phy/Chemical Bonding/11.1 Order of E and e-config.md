# Order of Energy and e-config
Experimentally, energy order of MOs for **diatomic** homonuclear molecules are determined (given below).

Internuclear axis is z-axis.

MO electronic configuration is written on the bases of the three rules,  [[02 e-config Rules|Pauli, Aufbau and Hund's.]]

If e is removed from AMO, it will be removed easily and the molecule is stabilized. This is the reason, $\ce{ IE_{O_{2}} < IE_{O} }$. 

If e is removed from BMO, it will not be removed easily and thus more energy will be required. This is the reason, $\ce{ IE_{N_{2}} > IE_{N} }$

### Total number of e $>$ 14
(general energy order)
Energy order for $\ce{ O_{2}, F_{2} etc. }$

$$
\sigma 1s 
< \sigma ^{*}1s 
< \sigma 2s 
< \sigma ^{*}2s 
< \sigma 2p_{z}
< \underbrace{ \pi 2p_{x} = \pi 2p_{y} }_{ \text{degenerate} } 
< \underbrace{ \pi ^{*} 2p_{x} = \pi ^{*} 2p_{x} }_{ \text{degenerate} } 
< \sigma ^{*}2p_{z}
$$

### Total number of e $\leq$ 14
Energy order for $\ce{ B_{2}, C_{2}, N_{2} etc. }$

$$
\sigma 1s 
< \sigma ^{*}1s 
< \sigma 2s 
< \sigma ^{*}2s 
< \underbrace{ \pi 2p_{x} = \pi 2p_{y} }_{ \text{degenerate} }
< \sigma 2p_{z}
< \underbrace{ \pi ^{*} 2p_{x} = \pi ^{*} 2p_{x} }_{ \text{degenerate} } 
< \sigma ^{*}2p_{z}
$$

This jump in energy of $\sigma 2p_{z}$ is due to *s and p mixing* of appropriate MOs to form modified MOs with different energies.

### Bond Order
$$BO = \frac{ N_{b} - N_{a} }{ 2 }$$
where,
$N_{b} \to$ number of e in BMO
$N_{a} \to$ number of e in AMO
Alternatively, 
$$BO = \frac{ \text{no of e in last BMO} - \text{no of e in last AMO } }{ 2 }$$

If BO is zero, then the molecules does not exist. 

BO $\uparrow\implies$ Thermodynamic Stability $\uparrow$ and Bond Length $\downarrow$
In general, when species have the same BO, then the species having less anti-bonding e is thermodynamically more stable.

Thermodynamic stability $\propto$ Bond strength

In case BOs are equal then greater are the number of AB e, the lower will be the stability. Same with Bond length. The more stable a molecule the lesser is the bond length. 

If bond order is fractional, it indicates the presence of unpaired e. Thus the molecule will be **Paramagnetic.**
If bond order is integer then the molecule may be **Paramagnetic** as well as **Diamagnetic.**

If there are 2 e in an orbital then those are paired. Thus, $\ce{ N_{2} }$ is a diamagnetic as all the e are paired.

### MO diagram (Energy level diagram)
On both sides are the AOs of combining atoms, in the middle are the resultant MOs. 

The e are filled equivalent to the MO configuration. 

**HOMO:** Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital 
**LUMO:** Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital 

When we provide energy the e transitions from HOMO to LUMO.

Here, $\pi 2p_{x} = \pi  2p_{y}$ is HOMO and $\sigma 2p_{z}$ is the LOMO

To find which bond is formed, we check which of the MOs are un-cancelled by their corresponding AMOs. I.e. the bond in which the net stabilizing e enter is the bond formed between the atoms. 

In $\ce{ B_{2} }$, the bond is $\pi$ as only $\pi 2p_{x} = \pi  2p_{y}$ in un-cancelled. Stabilizing e are entering into $\pi$ orbitals.

### Spin Magnetic Moment
or Spin only Magnetic Moment
$$\mu_{s} = \sqrt{ x(x+2) }$$
where $x \to$ number of unpaired e.
