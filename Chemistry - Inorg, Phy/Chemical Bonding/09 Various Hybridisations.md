# Examples of Various Hybridisations
## $sp$
$\ce{ CO_{2}, CS_{2}, C_{2}H_{2}, C_{3}O_{2}, BeCl_{2} }$. All of them are linear.

![[Pasted image 20230526210700.png]]

$\ce{ C_{3}O_{2} }$ is called **Carbon Suboxide**
![[Pasted image 20230526210708.png]]

At room temp. $\ce{ BeCl_{2} {}_{(s)} }$ is a polymeric chain like compound, #important

## [[09.1 sp2|sp]]$^2$

## $sp^{3}$
$\ce{ CH_{4}, CCl_{4}, CF_{4}, NH_{3}, H_{2}O, NF_{3}, PCl_{3}, PF_{3}, SiF_{4}, etc. }$

Be in $\ce{ BeCl_{2} }$ is $sp^{3}$ hybridised.

$\ce{ NH_{3} }$ reacts with $\ce{ BF_{3} }$ by giving B N's lone pair.  This compound is called **Adduct** or Addition Product. Both B and N are $sp^{3}$ in the Adduct.

### Borax 
$$\ce{ Na_{2}B_{4}O_{7}.10H_{2}O }$$

It is actually 
$$\ce{ 2Na+[B_{4}O_{5}(OH)4]^{2-} + 8H_{2}O }$$

$\ce{ [B_{4}O_{5}(OH)4]^{2-} }$ is the anion of borax which is a cyclic structure with O bridging the B. 
Two B are $sp^{2}$ and 2 are $sp^{3}$.

### Sod. peroxoborate 
$$\ce{ 2Na+[B_{2}O_{4}(OH)]^{2-} }$$
It is commonly used as brightener in washing powder.

## $sp^{3}d, sp^{3}d^{2}, sp^{3}d^{3}$
$\ce{ PCl_{5} }$, perfectly TBP structure.

$\ce{ PCl_{5} {}_{(g)} }$ is a covalent molecule, however, $\ce{ PCl_{5} {}_{(s)} }$ is an ionic solid. 
$$\ce{ PCl_{5} {}_{(s)} -> PCl_{4}+ + PCl_{6}- }$$
Similarly,
$$\ce{ PBr_{5} {}_{(s)} -> PBr_{4}+ + Br- }$$
$$\ce{ PI_{5} {}_{(s)} -> PI_{4}+ + I- }$$

But, $\ce{ PF_{5} }$ is covalent in both gas and solid state. This is due to very strong P-F bonds. Also, all 5 P-F bonds are found of equal bond length. 

The following compounds also become ionic in solid or liquid state.

$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
BrF_{3} {}_{(l)} &<=> BrF_{2}^{+} + BrF_{4}^{-} \\
N_{2}O_{2} {}_{(s)} &<=> NO+ + NO_{3}- \\
N_{2}O_{5} {}_{(s)} &<=> NO_{2}+ + NO_{3}- \\
XeF_{6} {}_{(s)} &<=> XeF_{5}^{+} + F^{-} \\
}
\end{split}
$$

$\ce{ ICl_{3} }$ exists as a dimer $\ce{ I_{2}Cl_{6} }$, and is planar.  
![[Pasted image 20230530205829.png]]

It also becomes ionic in liquid,
$$\ce{ I_{2}Cl_{6} {}_{(l)} <=> ICl_{2}+ + ICl_{4}- }$$


Some compounds of Xenon, 
**Xeonic Acid, $\ce{ H_{2}XeO_{4} }$** with Xenate ion $\ce{ XeO_{4}^{2-} }$,

**Perxenic Acid, $\ce{ H_{4}XeO_{6} }$** with Perxenate ion $\ce{ XeO_{6}^{4-} }$
![[Pasted image 20230530210231.png]]

$\ce{ PCl_{5} }$ exits because and not $\ce{ PH_{5} }$ because, Cl is more EN and thus it creates a partial +ve charge on P and thus the energy gap between the orbitals taking part in hybridisation is decreased enabling P to undergo hybridisation. H cannot do this as the EN of P and H are nearly equal and hence hybridisation does not occur. 

$\ce{ SF_{6} }$ exists but not $\ce{ SCl_{6} }$ because size of Cl is large and 6 Cl atoms cause heavy steric repulsions around the single S atom. 

$\ce{ IF_{7} }$ exists but not $\ce{ ICl_{7}, IBr_{7} }$ due to the same reason as before. 

### Misc. Examples
Potassium dichromate, $\ce{ K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7} }$. 6-CrO bonds are of equal length and bond energy. The terminal 6-Cr-O bonds are stronger than the bridged Cr-O bonds.
