An #important example of $\ce{ sp^{2} }$ is **Hydrazoic acid (or Hydrogen acid), $\ce{ HN_{3} }$.** It also has a anion, called **Azide ion.**

In hydrogen acid, the bond length between the two Ns with formal charges is lower.

### Borazine

Another #important example is **Borazine, $\ce{ B_{3}N_{3}H_{6} }$** which is called inorganic benzene or **Borazole.** Both of them are isoelectronic, isostructural and planar.  Both have delocalisation of pi bonds and are resonance stabilised. 

In benzene all C are $sp^{2}$ and in Borazole, all B and N are $sp^{2}$ hybridised.

Borazole however, has 4 disubstituted isomers.

Borazine is also much more reactive than benzene. Because in borazine B-N bonds are polar and hence reactive. But in benzene C-C bonds are non-polar and hence non reactive. 

On reaction with hydrochloric acid, all the Cl get attached to the more EN, Boron,

### Allotropes or Carbon
There are 3 allotropes, graphite $(\ce{ sp^{2} })$, diamonds $(\ce{ sp^{3} })$ and fullerenes e.g. $\ce{ C_{60} (sp^{2}) }$  called *Buckminster Fullerene.*

##### Graphite
Graphite has a 2D sheet like covalently bonded network structure. Each C is $sp^{2}$ hybridised. Two layers are approx. 3.4 $\dot{A}$. The C-C bond length is very small, at about 1.4 $\dot{A}$. 

Two layers are connected via weak Van Der Waal's forces and thus can slide over one another. This is why it acts as a solid lubricants. It is relatively soft. 

Along the sheet, graphite is a good electrical conductor due to delocalisation of pi e. However, it is a poor conductor across the sheet. 

**Graphite is anisotropic w.r.t electrical property.**
Increasing temp. *decreases conductivity along the sheet* but *increases conductivity across it.* **Thus it is metallic conductor along the sheet and a semiconductor across the sheet.** #important 

Thermodynamically, **graphite is the most stable allotrope.** For this reason, $\Delta H^{\circ}_{f}(\text{Graphite}) = 0$.
Order of stability is: Graphite > Diamond > Fullerene.

##### Diamond
**Diamond** is a 3D covalently bonded network structure. Every C is $sp^{3}$ hybridised. It has grater mp, bp and density than graphite. However, mp, bp are really high for both of them. 

It is the hardest known material and hence is a very good abrasive. 

It is a poor conductor of electricity. However, **diamond is a very good conductor of heat** and is thus used in making machine tools for cutting stones, hard metals, glass etc.

##### Fullerenes
$\ce{ C_{60} }$ is called **Buckminster Fullerene** and is a football like structure consisting of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons with each C being $sp^{2}$ hybridised. There are 2 different types of C-C bonds. It has as lower mp and bp than diamond or graphite. It is used in nano technology.
