# Metallic Bond
Found in metals and alloys. 

**Metal Kernel:** nucleus plus  the inner e. 

It has two approaches,

#### e-sea model
It is an old approach. 

In this, metal kernels occupy the lattice positions and these kernels are surrounded by e cloud of valence e. Metallic bond is the electrostatic force of attraction between the kernels and valence e. 

Thus metals in general are good conductor of electricity due to the movement of free e under electric field. 

Strength of metallic bond for s-block metals is directly proportional to number of valence e per metal atom (or number of metallic bonds per metal atom) and inversely to size of metal.

Higher metallic bond strength means greater mp and hardness.
Thus, order of mp,
$$\ce{ li > Na > K > Rb > Cs }$$
$$\ce{ Al > Mg > Na }$$

Metals show lustre due to oscillating free e when freshly cut. 

In d-block, the ns and the unpaired e in (n-1)d take part in metallic bonding. This is why mp and hardness of d-block metals are much higher than s-block metals. 

Thus, in 3d series, the order of mp is,

Mn is lower than Cr because it has half filled and fully filled d and s orbitals and thus the delocalisation does not happen properly. 

Zn, Cd, Hg are volatile metals. This is used in metallurgy. 

#### Band Model
Based on [[11 Molecular Orbital Theory]]

n number of metal atoms through LCAO combine to form n number of $\sigma$ s MOs which are filled. Since n is very large, the energy difference between each individual MO is negligible and they appear as a band. This full band is called the **Valence Band** and is HOMO. 

The empty p orbitals also combine to form an empty band above the fully filled s orbital one. This one is called **Conduction Band** and is LUMO. 

The difference between their energies is called **Band Gap.**

When external electric field is applied, e jump from valence band to conduction band. This is why metals are good conductors.

Based on band gap, we defined conductors, semi-conductors and insulators.
1. If band gap is infinitesimally small or bands overlap, then they are conductors. 
2. If band gap is small, then they are semi-conductors.
3. If the band gas is really large, then they are called insulators.
