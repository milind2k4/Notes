# e-configs of some Molecules
- **$\ce{ H_{2} }$**
$$\sigma 1s^{2}$$
the rest are there, but empty. Bond order is 1. 
$\\$

- **$\ce{ He_{2} }$**
$$\sigma 1s^{2},\ \sigma^{*} 1s^{2}$$
however, it does not exits, as bond order is 0. 
$\\$

- **$\ce{ Li_{2} }$**
$$\sigma 1s^{2},\ \sigma ^{*}s^{2},\ \sigma 2s^{2}$$
bond order is 1. $\ce{ Li_{2} }$ exists in vapour form, however, Li exists as metal lattice at room temp. 
$\\$

- **$\ce{ B_{2} }$**
$$\sigma 1s^{2},\ \sigma ^{*}1s^{2},\ \sigma 2s^{2},\ \sigma ^{*} 2s^{2},\ \pi 2p_{x}^{1} = \pi 2p_{y}^{1}$$
bond order is 1. $\mu_{s} = \sqrt{ 8 }$ and $\pi$ bond.
$\\$

- **$\ce{ C_{2} }$**
	$$\sigma 1s^{2},\ \sigma ^{*}1s^{2},\ \sigma 2p^{2},\ \sigma ^{*}2s^{2},\ \pi 2p_{x}^{2}=\pi 2p_{y}^{2}$$
	bond order is 2. $\mu_{s} = 0$ and $\pi$ bonds. 

	It can also be represented as,
	$$KK,\ \sigma 2p^{2},\ \sigma ^{*}2s^{2},\ \pi 2p_{x}^{2}=\pi 2p_{y}^{2}$$
	here, KK shows that the first shell of both the orbitals are fully filled. 
	$\\$

- **$\ce{ O_{2} }$**
$$
\sigma 1s^{2},\ 
\sigma ^{*}1s^{2},\ 
\sigma 2s^{2},\ 
\sigma ^{*} 2s^{2}, 
\sigma 2p_{z}^{2},\ 
\pi 2p_{x}^{2} = \pi 2p_{y}^{2},\ 
\pi ^{*} 2p_{x}^{1} = \pi ^{*} 2p_{y}^{1},\ 
$$
bond order is 2, one sigma and one pi. It is paramagnetic with 2 unpaired e and $\mu_{s} = \sqrt{ 8 }$. This is experimentally verified. 
$\\$


- **$\ce{ N_{2} }$**
$$\sigma 1s ^{2}
,\ \sigma ^{*}1s ^{2}
,\ \sigma 2s ^{2}
,\ \sigma ^{*}2s ^{2}
,\ \pi 2p_{x} ^{2} = \pi 2p_{y} ^{2}
,\ \sigma 2p_{z} ^{2} 
,\ \pi ^{*} 2p_{x} = \pi ^{*} 2p_{x}
,\ \ \sigma ^{*}2p_{z}$$
bond order is 3.

#### MO config for Ions
While writing MO configuration for an ion the energy order corresponding to the neutral molecule should be followed. 
 
For example in $\ce{ N_{2}^{-} }$ energy order corresponding to 14 e ($\ce{ N_{2} }$molecule) should be followed.
$$\sigma 1s ^{2}
,\ \sigma ^{*}1s ^{2}
,\ \sigma 2s ^{2}
,\ \sigma ^{*}2s ^{2}
,\ \pi 2p_{x} ^{2} = \pi 2p_{y} ^{2}
,\ \sigma 2p_{z} ^{2} 
,\ \pi ^{*} 2p_{x}^{1} = \pi ^{*} 2p_{x}
,\ \sigma ^{*}2p_{z}$$
bond order is 2.5. 

**$\ce{ O_{2}^{2+} }$**
$$
\sigma 1s^{2},\
\sigma ^{*} 1s^{2} ,\
\sigma 2s^{2} ,\
\sigma ^{*}2s^{2},\
\sigma 2p_{z}^{2},\ 
\pi 2p_{x}^{2} = \pi 2p_{y}^{2}
$$
bond order is 3. 

#### MO config for Heteronuclear Molecules
The energy order of MO can also be used for hetero nuclear molecules, the one exception is CO molecule.

**$\ce{ NO }$**
$$
\sigma 1s^{2},\
\sigma ^{*} 1s^{2} ,\
\sigma 2s^{2} ,\
\sigma ^{*}2s^{2},\
\sigma 2p_{z}^{2},\ 
\pi 2p_{x}^{2} = \pi 2p_{y}^{2},\ 
\pi ^{*}2p_{x}^{1} = \pi ^{*} 2p_{y}
$$
bond order is 2.5. 

**Exception:** 
$$\ce{ CO } =
\sigma 1s^{2},\
\sigma ^{*} 1s^{2} ,\
\sigma 2s^{2} ,\
\sigma ^{*}2s^{2},\
\pi 2p_{x}^{2} = \pi 2p_{y}^{2},\ 
\sigma 2p_{z}^{2}
$$
bond order is 3 

In $\ce{ CO+ }$, the bond order is expected to be 2.5, i.e. the bond length is expected to be longer than in CO. But it was found that in CO, the bond length is $\ce{ 1.128 \dot{A} }$, and in $\ce{ CO+ }$ it was found to be $1.115\ \dot{A}$. 

Thus BO in $\ce{ CO+ }$ is more than 3, hence the above MO config is incorrect. 

The correct is
$$
1 \sigma^{2},\ 
2\sigma^{2} ,\ 
1 \pi^{4},\
3\sigma^{2}
$$
it is however, not needed in JEE.
