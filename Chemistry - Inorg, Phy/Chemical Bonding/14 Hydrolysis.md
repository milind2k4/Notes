# Hydrolysis 
**Hydration:** ion-dipole interaction when an ionic compound is mixed with polar solvent. Ions hydrate through multiple layers.

**Hydrolysis:** reach with water to form covalent or coordinate bond. 
In general covalent bonds undergo hydrolysis whereas ionic compounds undergo mainly hydration along with hydrolysis. 

Two layers are formed, inner is hydrolysis, the outer is hydration.

($\ce{ Cl- }$ is the same as before)

### Hydrolysis of some Halides
Hydrolysis mainly occurs via coordinate bond formation between lone pair of water and and vacant orbital, usually of central atom. 

Hydrolysis of $\ce{ BCl_{3} }$, boric acid, which is a Lewis acid, is formed.

$\ce{ BF_{3} }$ undergoes partial hydrolysis, because $\ce{ HF }$ reacts with $\ce{ BF_{3} }$.

However, the same does not happen with $\ce{ BCl_{3} }$ and $\ce{ HCl }$, because Cl is big and thus provides high steric repulsions. 

$\ce{ CCl_{4}, CH_{3}Cl, CH_{2}Cl_{2}, CHCl_{3} }$ do not undergo hydrolysis because C has no vacant orbitals. 

However, under extreme conditions, $\ce{ CCl_{4} }$ reacts with steam to form **Phosgene Gas** which is highly poisonous. 
$$\ce{ CCl_{4} + H_{2}O  {}_{(g)} ->[\Delta ] COCl_{2} + 2HCl }$$

$\ce{ SiCl_{4} }$ undergoes hydrolysis because it has vacant d-orbitals in valence shell. It hydrolyses to form Silicic acid which loses one water to form Polymeric meta silicic acid.

$$\ce{ SiCl_{4} + H_{2}O -> H_{4}SiO_{4} ->[- H_{2}O] (H_{2}SiO_{3})_{n} }$$

$\ce{ SiF_{4} }$ undergoes partial hydrolysis similar to $\ce{ BF_{3} }$. It reacts with HF to form $\ce{ H_{2}SiF_{6} }$, Fluorosilisic acid.

$\ce{ SF_{3}, S_{2}F_{2}, S_{2}Cl_{2} }$ undergo disproportionation reaction when hydrolysed and form sulphur dioxide and sulphur.
$\ce{ SF_{4} }$ undergoes hydrolysis to form sulphur dioxide, and does not disproportionate. 
$\ce{ SF_{6} }$ does not undergo hydrolysis as it is inert because S is sterically surrounded by  6 F atoms and does not allow water to attack.

Interhalogen compound when hydrolyses, small halogen forms hydra acid and larger halogen forms oxyacid in same OS.
