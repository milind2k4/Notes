# Effect of Conc. and Partial Pressure
[[01  Law of Mass Action]]

Experimentally, it was found that,
$$\ce{ Rate \propto [A]^{p}[B]^{q} }$$
Thus we can write,
$$\ce{ Rate = k_{r}[A]^{p}[B]^{q} }$$
This equation is called *Rate Law.*

p and q are called partial order wrt A and B and they may or may not be equal to the stoichiometric coefficient of substance. 

$\ce{ k_{r} }$ is the rate constant of reaction and $m = p + q$ is the order of reaction.

#### Order of Reaction 
It is the sum of exponents of all concentration terms appearing in rate law. 
It can be +ve, -ve or zero or fractional. It is determined *experimentally.* It cannot be predicted by just seeing stoichiometry of reaction.

Order reflects the sensitivity of rate of reaction with variation in concentration. 

For example, rate of the below reaction does not depend on concentration,
$$\ce{ H_{2} + Cl_{2} ->[h\nu] 2HCl, Rate = k }$$

The order of below reaction is first order,
$$\ce{ 2N_{2}O_{5} -> 4NO_{2} + O_{2}, Rate = k[N_{2}O_{5}] }$$

The following reaction is second order,
$$\ce{ 2HI ->[\Delta] I_{2} + H_{2}, Rate = k[HI]^{2} }$$

And the following is zero order,
$$\ce{ 2HI ->[\Delta][gold surface] H_{2} + I_{2}, Rate = k }$$

#### Rate Constant 
Rate constant or velocity constant or specific reaction rate is equal to rate of reaction if all concentrations of substance involved in rate law are set equal to unity. 

Its unit depends on order of reaction.

$$\ce{ k = \frac{ Rate }{ [A]^{p}[B]^{q} } = \frac{ mol l^{-1} s^{-1} }{ [mol l^{-1}]^{p+q} } }$$

Thus, for zero order reaction, unit of k is $\ce{ mol l^{-1} s^{-1} }$. 
Thus, for first order reaction, unit of k is $\ce{ s^{-1} }$. 
Thus, for second order reaction, unit of k is $\ce{ mol^{-1} l s^{-1} }$. 

It increases with temp..

#### Rate constant of Disappearance and Appearance 

We have,
$$\ce{ Rate = - \frac{ 1 }{ a }\frac{ d[A] }{ dt } = - \frac{ 1 }{ b }\frac{ d[B] }{ dt } = \frac{ 1 }{ c }\frac{ d[C] }{ dt } = \frac{ 1 }{ d }\frac{ d[D] }{ dt } }$$

Also,
$$\ce{ Rate = k[A]^{p}[B]^{q} }$$

Thus,
$$\ce{ -\frac{ d[A] }{ dt } = ak[A]^{p}[B]^{q} }$$
$$\ce{ -\frac{ d[A] }{ dt } = k_{A}[A]^{p}[B]^{q} }$$
Where $k_{A} = ak$. 
I.e. 
$$\ce{ k = \frac{ k_{A} }{ a } = \frac{ k_{B} }{ b } = \frac{ k_{C} }{ c } = \frac{ k_{D} }{ d } }$$

Where $\ce{ k_{A}, k_{B}, k_{C}, k_{D} }$ are rate constants for A, B, C, D.

Thus rate constant of reaction may or may not be the same as the rate constant of disappearance or appearance of substance.
