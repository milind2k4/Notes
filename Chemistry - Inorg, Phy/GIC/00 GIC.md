# General Inorganic Chemistry 
aka **Reaction Prediction**

There are 4 kinds of reactions,
- Acid Base Neutralisation 
- Precipitation 
- Complex Formation 
- Redox

Species which are in their higher OS act as oxidising agents and species which are in their lower OS act as reducing agents.

Those which are in their intermediate OS can act as both.

##### Some Common OA and RA

$\ce{ NH_{4}+_{(aq)} }$ is not easily oxidised even by $\ce{ KMnO_{4} }$.

##### Disproportionation Reaction 
Reverse of disproportionation is called comproportionation.

**Halogen,**
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
Cl_{2}, Br_{2}, I_{2} &->[dil. NaOH] X- + XO- \\
Cl_{2}, Br_{2}, I_{2} &->[conc. NaOH] X- + XO_{3}- \\ 
 }
\end{split}
$$
$\ce{ XO- }$ is called Hypohalite ion
$\ce{ XO_{3}- }$ is called halate ion

**White phosphorous,**
$$\ce{ P_{4} + NaOH + H_{2}O ->[\Delta] PH_{3} ^ + NaH_{2}PO_{2} }$$
$\ce{ PH_{3} }$ is phosphine. 
$\ce{ NaH_{2}PO_{2} }$ is sod. hypophosphite.

**Sulphur,**
$$\ce{ S + NaOH ->[\Delta] Na_{2}S + \underset{ hypo soln }{ Na_{2}S_{2}O_{3} } + H_{2}O }$$

##### Ammonia Gas
Ammonium salts on reaction with strong bases liberate ammonia gas.

Similar behaviour is shown by Phosphonium salts.

Metals Nitrides/Phosphides on hydrolysis product ammonia/phosphine gas.

##### Dehydrating agent 
conc. $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$ is a powerful dehydrating agent. 

conc. $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4}/HCl }$ has strong affinity got moisture and the reaction is highly exothermic.

Dehydration of glucose and sucrose is called Charring Action.

![[Pasted image 20240228164348.png]]

$\ce{ P_{4}O_{10} }$ is the most powerful and dehydrating agent. 

Common de-hydrants are,
$\ce{ P_{4}O_{10}, conc. H_{2}SO_{5}, Anhydrous CaCl_{2}, Anhydrous CuSO_{4} }$

![[Pasted image 20240228164738.png]]

dil. $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$ gives toxic vapours of HCN on reaction with any cyanide salt.
conc. $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$ gives $\ce{ CO }$ on reaction with any cyanide salt.

These are not redox reactions as C is present in +2 OS in all the compounds.

##### Amphoteric Metals 
Zn and Al are amphoteric and liberate $\ce{ H_{2} }$ on reaction with acids as well as bases.

$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
Zn, Al + HCl &-> H_{2} + ZnCl_{2}, AlCl_{3} \\
Zn, Al + NaOH &-> H_{2} + \underset{ sod. zincate }{ Na_{2}ZnO_{2} }, \underset{ sod. meta aluminate }{ NaAlO_{2} }
 }
\end{split}
$$

Thus, these metals can act as good RA in both acidic or basic medium as $\ce{ H_{2} }$ acts as reducing agent.

### [[02 Hydrolysis]]

### Hydrogen Extraction
Stronger bases than $\ce{ OH- }$ can fetch $\ce{ H+ }$ from water, alcohol, carboxylic acid, etc.

### Highly Stable Oxides 
$\ce{ MgO, Al_{2}O_{3}, B_{2}O_{3} }$ are so stable that they do not decompose even at very high temp.. Thus they are used to make inner linings of furnaces.
