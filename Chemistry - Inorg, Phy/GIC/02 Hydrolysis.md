There are 3 kinds of anhydrides, of acid, of base and mixed.

Hydrolysis could be acidic, alkaline or neutral.
The final product will be products of the corresponding reaction with acid or base after hydrolysis.

Oxyacid has a general formula,
$$\ce{ H_{m}XO_{n} or (OH)_{m}XO_{n-m} }$$
where X is the central atom.

In general, if n - m (no. of O in (OH) form) is more than or equal to 2, then it is SA. If it is less than 2, it is WA.

As we heat an oxyacid, its corresponding oxides or anhydrides are formed. And as we add water to oxide, we sometimes get back the oxyacids. 

Some oxides which are not soluble in water do not form oxyacids on addition of water.

Most metal oxides are water insoluble except alkali metals and oxides of Ba, Sr, Ca (CaO is partially soluble). BeO and MgO are insoluble. 

If metal in metal oxide is present in very high OS (more than 5), then it is soluble in water.

#### Halides and Oxyhalides 
##### B family
For $\ce{ BF_{3} }$ only 25% reactant is hydrolysed.

Al halides undergo similar hydrolysis as B halides.
$$\ce{ AlCl_{3} + 3H_{2}O -> Al(OH)3 v + 3HCl }$$

##### C family
C halides do not undergo hydrolysis because C does not have vacant orbitals to accept lp from water. 

With steam, $\ce{ CCl_{4} }$ forms phosgene which is a poisonous gas.

$\ce{ SiF_{4} }$ similar to $\ce{ BF_{3} }$ undergoes partial hydrolysis. 33% of reactant is hydrolysed.

Tin halide undergoes partial hydrolysis and Lead (IV) halide forms lead (IV) oxide which is black ppt. Lead (II) halide is insoluble.

##### N family
$\ce{ NF_{3} }$ undergoes negligible hydrolysis due to its almost non polar nature.

Sb and Bi halides do not form hydrolysed product. Instead, they form oxy cation. #important

##### O family
+1, +2 OS halides of S undergo disproportionation during hydrolysis as they are unstable.

$\ce{ SF_{6} }$ is an inert compound as small size S is completely surrounded by 6F, thus does not undergo hydrolysis. 

$\ce{ SeF_{6}, TeF_{6} }$ form similar products but since Te is bigger, 6 OH are stable around it while they are unstable around Se.

##### Interhalogen Compound
For interhalogen compound, on hydrolysis the smaller halogen forms hydracid and the larger forms oxyacid.

##### Halide Salts
Halide salts form corresponding acids.
