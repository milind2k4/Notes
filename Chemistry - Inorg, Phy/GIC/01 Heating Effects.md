##### Carbonates/Bicarbonates 
Carbonates on heating give oxide and $\ce{ CO_{2} }$ gas.

Salts of Ag/Hg give metal on heating. 
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
Ag_{2}CO_{3} &->[\Delta] 2Ag + CO_{2} + O_{2} \\
HgCO_{3} &->[\Delta] Hg + CO_{2} + O_{2}
 }
\end{split}
$$

Bicarbonates on heating give metal carbonate and $\ce{ CO_{2} }$ gas.

##### Nitrates
Nitrates on heating give  nitrides.

Sodium nitrate give different products at 500 and 800 C.
Silver and Mercury nitrates give metal.

##### Sulphates
Sulphates are thermally more stable and thus need to be heated more for decomposition.

Alkali metal sulphates do not decompose.

##### Oxalates

##### Ammonium Salts 
In ammonium salt, if anion is good OA, then product will be $\ce{ N_{2} or N_{2}O }$. 

If anion is non oxidising, then $\ce{ NH_{3} }$ is produced.

Oxidising anions are,
$$\ce{ NO_{2}-, NO_{3}-, Cr_{2}O_{7}^{2-}, MnO_{4}-, ClO_{4}-, IO_{3}-, etc. }$$

Non-oxidising anions are,
$$\ce{ Cl-, Br-, I-, C_{2}O_{4}^{2-}, CO_{3}^{2-}, SO_{4}^{2-}, PO_{4}^{2-} etc. }$$

The final product formed has OS the average of the N in the reactant.

Metal azides are used as explosives and heating them gives pure nitrogen gas.

##### Salts having Acidic H 
Water is removed. 

Heating $\ce{ NaHPO_{4} }$ gives $\ce{ (NaPO_{3})6 }$ (sod. meta phosphate) which is *Calgon* and it is used in removal of permanent hardness of water.

##### Oxyacids
Some oxyacids in intermediate OS undergo disproportionation reaction on heating.

##### Halides 
Covalent halides easily undergo hydrolysis. 

On heating hydrated halides, oxides are formed instead of anhydrous salts due to internal hydrolysis. 

However, in presence of dry HCl, anhydrous salt is obtained on heating covalent halides.

On heating ionic halides however, water of crystallisation is removed.
