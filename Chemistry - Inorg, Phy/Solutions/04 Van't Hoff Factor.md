# Van't Hoff Factor (i)
[[04 Relation between VD and Dissociation constant]]

When the solute undergoes dissociation or association in solution. 

We know that colligative properties are directly proportional to no. of moles of solute present in solution. 

Van't Hoff Factor is defined as,
$$i = \frac{ \text{obs. or exp. or abnormal CP} }{ \text{normal or theo. CP considering no diss. or ass.} }$$
Thus,
$$i = \frac{ \text{actual no. of moles of solute in solution} }{ \text{no. of moles of solute initially taken} }$$
Since $n \propto 1 /M$, we get,
$$i = \frac{ M_\text{normal} }{ M_\text{abnormal} }$$

**Note:** Carboxylic acid act as acid in water i.e. they dissociate in water ($i > 1$). But these carboxylic acids form H bonded dimer in non polar solvent such as benzene ($i < 1$).

##### Dissociation 
No. of particles are increasing and thus, $i > 1$. 
Thus,
$$M_\text{abnormal} < M_\text{normal}$$

$$
\begin{split}
i &= \frac{ a(1 - \alpha) + na\alpha }{ a } \\
&= 1 + (n-1)\alpha 
\end{split}
$$
where $\alpha$ is degree of dissociation of solute and n is the no. of moles of aqueous products per mole of reactant. 

Thus, $i$ does not depend on initial conc. or no. of moles of solute.

##### Association 
No. of particles are decreasing and thus, $i < 1$.
Thus,
$$M_\text{abnormal} > M_\text{normal}$$

$$
\begin{split}
i &= \frac{ a(1-\alpha) + a\alpha /n }{ a } \\
&= n(1-\alpha) + \alpha \\
&= 1 + \left( \frac{ 1 }{ n }-1 \right)\alpha
\end{split}
$$
where n is the no. of moles of aqueous reactants per mole of aqueous product. 
and $\alpha$ is the degree of association. 

#### New Colligative Properties 
The no. of moles of solute will be multiplied by $i$ and thus molality will be multiplied by $i$.

Thus, 
- **RLVP,**
	$$\frac{ p_{o} - p_{s} }{ p_{o} } = \frac{ in }{ in + N }$$
	$$\frac{ p_{o} - p_{s} }{ p_{s} } = \frac{ in }{ N }$$
	where $p_{s}$ is experimental VP of solute.

- **EBP,**
	$$\Delta T_{b} = T_{b(o)} - T_{b(s)} = i \times k_{b} \times m$$
	where $T_{b(o)}$ is the observed bp of solution. 

- **DFP,**
	$$\Delta T_{f} = i \times k_{f} \times m$$

- **OP,**
	$$\pi = iCRT$$
