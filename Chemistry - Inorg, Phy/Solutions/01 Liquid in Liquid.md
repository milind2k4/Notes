# Liquid in Liquid Solution
$x_{A}, x_{B}$ are mole fraction of A and B in liquid mix. at equilibrium. 
$y_{A}, y_{B}$ are mole fraction of A and B in vapours at equilibrium. 
$p_{A}, p_{B}$ are VP contributed by components A and B.
$p^{o}_{A}, p^{o}_{B}$ are VP of pure A and B.
$p_{T}$ is the VP of solution.

We assume that the amount of vapours is not very high.

### Raoult's Law 
*At a given temp. the partial vapour pressure of each component is directly proportional to it's mole fraction in solution.* 

$$
\begin{split}
p_{A} &\propto x_{A} \\
p_{A} &= x_{A} p^{o}_{A} \\
\end{split}
$$

Thus total pressure, of a two liquid solution,
$$p_{T} = p^{o}_{A} x_{A} + p^{o}_{B} x_{B}$$
This is the VP of the solution.

Now, according to Dalton's law,
$$
\begin{split}
p_{A} &= y_{A} p_{T} \\
p_{B} &= y_{B} p_{T} \\
\end{split}
$$

Equating the equations,
$$
\begin{split}
x_{A}p^{o}_{A} &= y_{A}p_{T} \\
x_{B} p_{B}^{o} &= y_{B} p_{T} \\
\end{split}
$$

In a given phase,
$$
\begin{split}
x_{A} + x_{B} + x_{C} + \dots &= 1 \\
y_{A} + y_{B} + y_{C} + \dots &= 1
\end{split}
$$

Thus we can write,
$$
\begin{split}
\frac{ y_{B} \times p_{T} }{ p_{A}^{o} } + \frac{ y_{B} \times p_{T} }{ p_{B}^{o} } &= 1 \\
\frac{ 1 }{ p_{T} } &= \frac{ y_{A} }{ p_{A}^{o} } + \frac{ y_{B} }{ p_{B}^{o} }
\end{split}
$$

#### Graphical Representation 
For an ideal solution, the total pressure lies between $p_{A}^{o}$ and $p_{B}^{o}$ for any composition.

A pure liquid boils at a definite temp. at a given pressure i.e. has a fixed bp. 
But, an ideal solution doesn't have a fixed bp, it boils in a range of temp..

### Non Ideal Solution 
Liquid solution which doesn't follow Raoult's Law.

Examples of ideal solutions have components which have similar molecular weights. 
Examples of -ve deviations have acids and polar molecules.

### Fractional Distillation 
Method of separation of components due to the difference in their bp. 

Liquid composition must be different from the vapour composition. I.e. $x_{A} \neq y_{A}, x_{B} \neq y_{B}$.

The vapours will be more rich wrt the more volatile component of the solution, 
The vapours are taken out and condensed to liquid called *condensate or distillate.* This distillate has the same liquid composition as that of the vapour composition of the original liquid.

#### Azeotrope or Azeotropic Mix.
They are non ideal solutions of definite composition. 

They have the same composition in vapour and liquid phases and hence components cannot be separated by fractional distillation. 

It boils at a fixed temp., similar to pure liquid. 

There are two types of azeotropes,
1. **Minimum Boiling Azeotrope:** when there is +ve deviation from Raoult's law. The boiling point is lesser than that of constituent components. 
   
   Examples are the solutions which show +ve deviation. 
   Water + Ethanol 
   $\ce{ CCl_{4} + CHCl_{3} }$
   $\ce{ CCl_{4} + C_{2}H_{5}OH }$
