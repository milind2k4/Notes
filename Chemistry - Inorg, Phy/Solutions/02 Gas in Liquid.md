# Gas in Liquid Solution
Extent of solubility of gas in liquid depends on,
1. **Nature of Gas:** Every gas is soluble in liquid to some extent. 
1. **Nature of Liquid:** Like dissolves like. I.e. polar gases dissolve in polar liquids and non-polar gases in non-polar liquids. Also, the gases which ionise in solvent are freely soluble.
2. **Temp.:** Dissolving of gas in liquid is generally exothermic (increasing T decreases solubility) while dissolving solid is endothermic (increasing T increases solubility).
4. **Pressure:** Increasing pressure of gas increases its solubility.

### Henry's Law
At a given temp. solubility of a gas in liquid expressed as its mole fraction in liquid is directly proportional to pressure of gas.

$$
\begin{split}
x_{A} &\propto p_{A} \\ 
\frac{ n_{A} }{ n_{T} } &= kp_{A} \\
p_{A} &= \frac{ 1 }{ k } \frac{ n_{A} }{ n_{A} + n_{W} } \\
p_{A} &= k_{H} \frac{ n_{A} }{ n_{T} } \\
\end{split}
$$
where 
$k_{H}$ is **Henry's Law Constant of gas liquid pair.**
$n_{A}$ is the no. of moles of gas dissolved in liquid. 

For low solubility of gas, $n_{A} \ll n_{W}$, and thus we can write,
$$p_{A} = k_{H} \frac{ n_{A} }{ n_{W} }$$
This is used for solving questions. 

##### Some Notes
Henry's law applies to low soluble gases like $\ce{ H_{2}, He, N_{2}, O_{2} }$ etc.

Henry's law is not applicable if 
1. pressure is very high
2. gas dissociates in solvent 
3. temp. is very low

$k_{H}$ depend on temperature and gas liquid pair. 
$$T \uparrow \implies k_{H} \uparrow$$
Higher the value of $k_{H}$, the lower is the solubility. 

Decreasing $k_{H}$ value (for water) (increasing solubility),
$$\ce{ He > Ne > Ar > Kr > Xe }$$
$$\ce{ H_{2} > N_{2} > CO_{2} }$$

Unit of $k_{H}$ is the same as pressure.

##### Applications 
1. To increase solubility of $\ce{ CO_{2} }$ in soft drinks and soda water, the bottle is sealed under high pressure. 
2. Scuba divers have tanks filled with air diluted with helium to avoid bends (or decompression).
1. The higher we go the lesser is the pressure and thus the solubility of air in the blood. This causes weakness and confusion a condition called **Anoxia.**
