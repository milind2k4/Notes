# Solutions
State of a matter depends on the intermolecular force and the thermal energy. 

In a liquid, both are intermediate. 

In liquid solution we have,
- Solid in Liquid: **Colligative Properties** 
- Liquid in Liquid: **Raoult's Law** 
- Gas in Liquid: **Henry's Law**

A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances, which are chemically non-reacting. 

The substance present is larger quantity is called **Solvent.** And the substance present in lesser amount is called **Solute.**

Those liquids which mix with each other and form homogeneous mixture are called **Miscible.** Those which do not mix are called **Immiscible.**

##### Vapour Pressure
[[00 Chemical Equilibrium#Vapour Pressure]]
[[00 Chemical Equilibrium#Relative Humidity (RH)]]

The pressure exerted by the vapours of a substance (liquid or solid) at equilibrium state at given temp.. At equilibrium, rate of evaporation becomes equal to the rate of condensation.

VP of a given substance depends on the temperature and is independent of surface area or amount of substance. 

$$\ln \frac{ p_{2} }{ p_{1} } = \frac{ \Delta H_{vap} }{ R } \left( \frac{ 1 }{ T_{1} } - \frac{ 1 }{ T_{2} } \right)$$
where $p_{1},p_{2}$ are the values of vapour pressure at temperatures $T_{1},T_{2}$ respectively. 

This equation is known as **Clausius Claypeyron Equation.**


**Volatility** refers to the tendency to make vapours. 
Substance with low VP is called *less volatile,* with high VP is called *highly volatile* and zero VP is called *non-volatile.*

For example, water is less volatile then ethanol due to greater extent of H bonding in water than ethanol. 

Most solids are non volatile and most liquids are volatile. 

##### Boiling Point
**Boiling Point (bp)** is the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the liquid is equal to the external pressure. 
$$\ce{ VP \propto \frac{ 1 }{ BP } }$$
this is because the more bp the more is the intermolecular forces. i.e. the less is the vp. 

**Normal Boiling Point (nbp)** is the temp. at which VP becomes 1 atm. 
nbp of water is 100 $^{\circ}$C. 

There may be infinite values of bp depending upon the external pressure.

#### Phase Diagram
Substance which has uniform composition and properties throughout is called its **Phase.** 

Phase diagram is the P vs T diagram for pure substance. 

Same physical state can have different phases. For example, all three of graphite, diamond and fullerenes are solids but all three are different phases. 

The point at which three phases are in equilibrium is called *triple point.* There may be more than one triple point in phase diagram of a substance. 

The solid lines are called *phase boundaries* and they represent equilibrium between the phases.

##### Phase Diagram of Water 
Exceptional nature of water phase diagram in melting part (-ve slope instead of +ve) is due to density of liquid water being more than that of solid water.

## Immiscible Liquid Mixture 
Which do not mix. 
Examples are water + benzene, chlorobenzene, nitrobenzene, mercury etc.

Immiscible mixture components vaporise independently and hence their VP is the sum of VP of individual components. 

![[Pasted image 20240312183945.png]]
Here, $x_{A} = 1 = x_{B}$. 
$$y_{A} p_{T} = x_{A} p_{A}^{o} = p_{A}^{o}$$
$$y_{B} p_{T} = x_{B} p_{B}^{o} = p_{B}^{o}$$

Such immiscible mix. can be boiled at a temp. lower than their individual bps. 
This concept is used in *steam distillation* of benzene, chlorobenzene, nitrobenzene etc.

Thus, we have,
$$
\begin{split}
\frac{ y_{A} }{ y_{B} } &= \frac{ p_{A}^{o} }{ p_{B}^{o} } \\
\frac{ W_{A} /M_{A} }{ W_{B} /M_{B} } &= \frac{ p_{A}^{o} }{ p_{B}^{o} }
\end{split}
$$
