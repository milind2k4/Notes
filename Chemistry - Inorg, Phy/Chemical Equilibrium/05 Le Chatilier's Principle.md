# Le Chatilier's Principle
If a change is applied to the system at equilibrium, then the equilibrium will be shifted in that direction which minimizes the effect of change and equilibrium is re established under the new condition.

However note that *the changed parameter need not come back to its initial value.* 

### Effect of Concentration/Partial Pressure
- Reactants:
	  - $[R] \uparrow \implies \text{Forward}$
	  - $[R] \downarrow \implies \text{Backward}$

- Products:
	- $[P] \uparrow \implies \text{Backward}$
	- $[P] \downarrow \implies \text{Forward}$

Adding any solid does not affect equilibrium. 

The concentration does not come back to original, but the value of equilibrium constant will not change.

In case the species are not in gaseous state, we solve using k,

### Effect of Pressure/Volume Variation
Pressure means system pressure and not the partial pressure of one of the gasses. 

#### Reaction involving at least one gaseous species
with or without solids or liquids

When P of system at equilibrium is increased by decreasing the volume of system, equilibrium shifts in the direction which produces lesser number of gas moles. 

But concentration of all the gaseous components are increased because decrease in volume is dominant in comparison to the decrease in number of moles.

When P is decreased, the concentration of all the gaseous components decreases. 

Also,
$\Delta n_{g}<0$ means that P is more at Reactant side.
$\Delta n_{g}>0$ means that P is more at Product side.

##### [A] comes back to original
In general, changed parameter does not come back to its orginal value, even when equilibrium is re-established, however in special case, e.g. when reactant is solid and equilibrium is established by starting with only reactants.

If volume is doubled, or $P_{sys}$ is decreased to half, equilibrium shifts forward. 

In this case, the new pressure will be the same as the original,

#### Reaction involving only solids and liquids
$$\ce{ H_{2}O_{(s)} <=> H_{2}O_{(l)} }$$

If system pressure of equilibrium system involving only solids and liquids is increased then equilibrium shifts in the direction which produces more dense phase. 

In general, density of solid is more than that of liquid, except in the case of Ice. 

Thus if there is melting and we increase the pressure, the melting point increases, except in ice - water, in which the mp decreases. 

In the case there is transition from one phase to another and we increase pressure, the transition temperature increases. 

#### Effect of Temperature 
If endothermic, increase in T increases k and thus the reaction moves forward. 

If exothermic, increase in T decreases k and thus the reaction moves backward. 

Thus,
- Exothermic 
	- $T \uparrow \implies \text{Backward}$
	- $T \downarrow \implies \text{Forward}$
	$\\$

- Endothermic 
	- $T \downarrow \implies \text{Backward}$
	- $T \uparrow \implies \text{Forward}$


#### Addition of Inert Gas
Those gases which do not react with anything in the equilibrium mixture. Thus the gas need not be 18th group elements like He, Ne or Ar.

- **At constant Volume and temp.:** No effect.
  This is because the concentration does not change as the volume is constant.  However, the total pressure of the system increases. 
  $\\$
- **At constant Pressure and temp.:** 
  Since volume is increased, the concentration of all gases decreases but the number of moles may increase or decrease and thus the equilibrium moves in the direction which has greater number of gas moles.
