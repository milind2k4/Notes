# Law of Mass Action
Given by Guldberg and Waage.

$$\ce{ aA + bB  <=> cC + dD }$$

Rate of reaction is directly proportional to the active masses of reactants raised to their respective stoichiometric coefficients. 

**Active Mass** is most commonly taken as molar concentration or partial pressure.

$$R_{f} \propto [A]^{a} \cdot [B]^{b}$$
$$R_{b} \propto [C]^{c} \cdot [D]^{d}$$
$$or$$
$$R_{f} \propto p_{A}^{a} \cdot p_{B}^{b}$$
$$R_{b} \propto p_{C}^{c} \cdot p_{D}^{d}$$

where $[A]$, $p$ mean concentration, partial pressure at equilibrium 

$$R_{f} = k_{f} [A]^{a} \cdot [B]^{b}$$
$$R_{b} = k_{b} [C]^{c} \cdot [D]^{d}$$
where $k_{f}, k_{b} \to$ rate constant of forward, backward reaction. They depend on temp. but *do not depend on active mass.*

### Active mass of various substances
1. For a substance in solution phase, molar concentration is active mass.
	$$\ce{ 2A {}_{(aq)} + B {}_{(aq)} <=> C {}_{(aq)} }$$
	$$
	\begin{split}
	R_{f} &= k_{f}[A]^{2}[B] \\
	R_{b} &= k_{b}[C]
	\end{split}
	$$

1. For gaseous substance, active mass may be taken as molar concentration or partial pressure.
	$$\ce{ N_{2} {}_{(g)} + 3H_{2} {}_{(g)} <=> 2NH_{3} {}_{(g)} }$$
	$$
	\begin{split}
	\ce{ 
	R_{f} &= k_{f}[N_{2}][H_{2}]^{3} \\
	R_{b} &= k_{b}[NH_{3}]^{2} \\
	&or \\
	R_{f} &= k'_{f}(p_{N_{2}})(p_{H_{2}})^{3} \\
	R_{b} &= k'_{b}(p_{NH_{3}})^{2}
	} 
	\end{split}
	$$

	Relation between Concentration and partial pressure for a gas,
	$$
	\begin{split}
	p_{A}V &= n_{A}RT \\
	p_{A} &= \frac{n_{A}}{V}RT \\
	p_{A} &= [A]RT
	\end{split}
	$$

3. For Pure solid or pure liquid is constant at a given temp. and does not depend on amount of substance. #important 
   $$\ce{ CaCO_{3} {}_{(s)} <=> CaO {}_{(s)} + CO_{2} {}_{(g)} }$$
   $$\ce{ [CaCO_{3}] = \frac{ n_{CaCO_{3}} }{ V_{CaCO_{3}} } = \frac{ d_{CaCO_{3}} }{ M_{CaCO_{3}} } }$$
   which is constant and does not depend on mass of $\ce{ CaCO_{3} }$ taken. 
   
   Active mass of pure solid and liquid is constant and *is taken to be $1$ in expression of rate of reactions and equilibrium constant.* 
	
	Thus,
	$$\ce{ R_{f} = k_{f}[CaCO_{3}] = k'_{f} }$$
	$$\ce{ R_{b} = k_{b}[CaO][CO_{2}] = k'_{b}[CO_{2}] }$$
	As the reaction moves forward, and as the moles of $\ce{ CaCO_{3} }$ decrease, the volume of it also decreases and the ratio remains constant. 
	$\\$
	
1. For solvent (in excess), active mass is taken to be constant. 
	$$\ce{ CH_{3}COOC_{2}H_{5}_{(aq)} + H_{2}O_{(l)} <=> CH_{3}COOH_{(aq)} +C_{2}H_{5}OH_{(aq)} }$$
	
	$$\ce{ R_{f} = k_{f}[CH_{3}COOC_{2}H_{5}][H_{2}O] = k'_{f}[CH_{3}COOC_{2}H_{5}] }$$
	
	As the amount of water consumed is negligible in front of the amount of water present. 
	$$\ce{ R_{b} = k_{b}[CH_{3}COOH][C_{2}H_{5}OH] }$$
	
	For the opposite reaction however,
	$$\ce{ CH_{3}COOH_{(l)} + C_{2}H_{5}OH_{(l)} <=> CH_{3}COOC_{2}H_{5}_{(l)} + H_{2}O_{(l)} }$$
	Since every component is miscible, soluble in each other and water is formed in small amounts it is not a solvent and thus we have not written $\ce{ {}_{(aq)} }$ here. And since the liquids are not pure, their active masses are not one. 
	
	Thus, 
	$$
	\begin{split}
	\ce{ 
	R_{f} &= k_{f} [Ch_{3}COOH][C_{2}H_{5}OH] \\
	R_{b} &= k_{b}[CH_{3}COOC_{2}H_{5}][H_{2}O] 
	}
	\end{split}
	$$

## Law of Chemical Equilibrium 
For a reversible reaction, at equilibrium state, $R_{f} = R_{b}$.

For a reaction,
$$\ce{ aA + bB <=> cC + dD }$$

At equilibrium,
$$k_{f} [A]^{a} \cdot [B]^{b} = k_{b} [C]^{c} \cdot [D]^{d}$$

Equilibrium constant of a reaction is the ratio of rate constants of forward and backward reactions.
$$k_{eq} = \frac{ k_{f} }{ k_{b} }  = \frac{ [C]^{c} \cdot [D]^{d} }{ [A]^{a} \cdot [B]^{b} }$$

Since equilibrium constant depends on rate constants, it only on temp. for a given reaction. It is independent of,
1. Concentration or partial pressure or system pressure.
2. Catalyst

### Various Equilibrium Constants
Concentration, if active masses are taken as molar concentration,
$$\ce{ k_{c} = \frac{ [NH_{3}]^{2} }{ [N_{2}] [H_{2}]^{3} } }$$
For gaseous equilibrium, both $k_{c}$ and $k_{p}$ can be defined. 

Partial Pressure, if active masses are taken in partial pressure,
$$\ce{ k_{p} = \frac{ p_{NH_{3}}^{2} }{ p_{N_{2}} . p_{H_{2}}^{3} } }$$

i.e.
$$k = \frac{ \text{Product} }{ \text{Reactants} }$$

#### Units
$$\ce{ k_{c} = \left( \frac{mol}{lit} \right)^{\Delta n_{g}} }$$
$$\ce{ k_{p} = (bar)^{\Delta n_{g}} or (atm)^{\Delta n_{g}} or (Pa)^{\Delta n_{g}}}$$
