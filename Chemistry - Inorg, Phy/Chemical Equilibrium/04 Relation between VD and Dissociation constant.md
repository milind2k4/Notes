# Relation b/w VD and $\alpha$
Relation between [[00 Mole Concept#Relative density|vapour density]] and Degree of Dissociation $(\alpha)$.

Also, $\alpha$ does not depend on initial number of  moles or concentration.

VD is inversely proportional to the total number of moles. 

**Degree of Dissociation** is the number of moles of reactant dissociated divided by number of moles of same reactant initially taken. (how many are broken/how many were taken)

$$\alpha = \frac{ x }{ a }$$
where $a$ is the original amount, and $x$ is the amount dissociated at equilibrium. 
And, $0 < \alpha \leq 1$.

Since the number of moles is increasing, VD decreases. 
Thus,
$$d_{i} > d_{eq}$$
Now,
$$d \propto \frac{1}{n_{t}}$$
Thus,
$$\frac{ d_{i} }{ d_{f} } = \frac{ n_{ti} }{ n_{tf} }$$
$$\frac{ d_{i} }{ d_{f} } = \frac{ a }{ a(1-\alpha) + na \alpha  }$$
Giving, 
$$\alpha = \frac{ d_{i} - d_{f} }{ (n-1)d_{f} }$$
$n$ is the sum of st. coefficients of gas products per mole of gas reactant 

Conceptually, we use,
$$M_{av} = \frac{ \text{total mass} }{ \text{total moles} }$$

For association reaction, we have degree of association,
$$\ce{ nX <=> Y }$$
$$\ce{ a(1-\alpha ) <=> \frac{ a\alpha }{ n } }$$
where $\alpha$ is degree of association,
$$\alpha =\frac{ \text{no of moles of reactant associated} }{ \text{total no. of moles of reactant originally taken} }$$

Thus,
$$\frac{ d_{f} }{ d_{i} } = \frac{ n_{ti} }{ n_{tf} }$$
$$\frac{ d_{f} }{ d_{i} } = \frac{ a }{ \displaystyle  a(1-\alpha) + \frac{ a\alpha  }{ n } }$$

Finally giving,
$$\alpha = \frac{ n(d_{f}-d_{i}) }{ (n-1)d_{f} }$$

But here too use the concept,
$$VD = \frac{1}{2} M_{av} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac { \text{total mass} }{ n_{t} } \right)$$

If temp, number of moles etc. are not given, assume that the reaction has started with only 1 mole of reactants.

If % dissociation is asked at a pressure, take that pressure as the equilibrium pressure,
