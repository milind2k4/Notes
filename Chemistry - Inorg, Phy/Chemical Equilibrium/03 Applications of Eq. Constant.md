# Application of $k_{eq}$
### Direction of Reaction
**Reaction Quotient $(Q)$:** $k_{c}$ or $k_{p}$ but the concentrations are not at equilibrium. It is at any instant. 

$$\ce{ aA {}_{(g)} + bB {}_{(g)} <=> cC {}_{(g)} dD {}_{(g)} }$$

$$Q_{c} = \frac{ [C]_{t}^{c} \cdot [D]_{t}^{d} }{ [A]_{t}^{a} \cdot [B]_{t}^{b} }$$

Reaction quotient becomes equilibrium constant $k$ at equilibrium. 

$Q$ is used to find the direction of reaction:
2. If reaction starts with both R and P,
	   - If **Q < k** then  **forward** and the system is called *unsaturated*
	   - If **Q = k** then we are at **equilibrium** and the reaction is called *saturated*
	   - If **Q > k** then **backward** and the reaction is called *oversaturate*
1. If reaction starts with only reactants, then it will always go forward. 
1. If reaction starts with only products, then it will always go backward. 

### Extent of Reaction
If the value of k is very high, much greater than 1, then almost all the reactants of limiting reactants is converted to products. 

Similarly, if the value of k is very low, much smaller than 1, then negligible amount of reactants is converted to products. 

## Calculation of Change in Concentration
$$\begin{matrix}
\ce{ 
& A &+& 2B& <=>& C & +& D & \\
Initial Moles:& a & & b & & c & & d \\  
Final Moles:& a - x & & b - 2x & & c + x & & d + x \\  
 }
\end{matrix}
$$
Thus k at equilibrium,
$$k_{c} = \frac{ (c+x)(d+x) }{ (a-x)(b-2x)^{2} } \times V$$
$$k_{p} = \frac{ p_{C}. p_{D} }{ p_{A}. p_{B}^{2} }$$

Since partial pressure of a component, $p_{A} = x_{A} p_{t}$,
$$k_{p} = 
\frac{ \displaystyle \frac{ c+x }{ \sum n } p_{eq} \times 
\frac{ d+x }{ \sum n } p_{eq} }
{ \displaystyle  \frac{ a-x }{ \sum n } p_{eq} \times 
\left( \frac{ b-2x }{ \sum n } p_{eq} \right)^{2} }$$
$$k_{p} = \frac{ (c+x)(d+x) }{ (a-x)(b-2x) } \times \frac{ \sum n }{ p_{eq} }$$
Where $\sum n$ is the number of moles. 

Formula:
> $$k_{c} = \frac{ (c+x)(d+x) }{ (a-x)(b-2x)^{2} } \times \left( \frac{ 1 }{ V } \right)^{\Delta n_{g}}$$
> $$k_{p} = \frac{ (c+x)(d+x) }{ (a-x)(b-2x)^{2} } \times \left( \frac{ p_{eq} }{ \sum n } \right)^{\Delta n_{g}}$$
