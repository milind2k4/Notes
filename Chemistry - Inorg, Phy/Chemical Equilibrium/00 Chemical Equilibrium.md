# Chemical Equilibrium
#### Irreversible
Unidirectional reaction in which reactants (at least the LR) is completely converted into products. 

Examples,
1. Acid Base Neutralisation: 
	$$\ce{ HCl + NaOH -> NaCl + H_{2}O }$$
2. Thermal Decomposing in *open vessel:*
	$$\ce{ CaCO_{2} ->[\Delta ] CaO + CO_{2} ^ }$$
	$$\ce{ NH_{4}HS ->[\Delta ] NH_{3} ^ + H_{2}S ^ }$$
3. Precipitation Reactions:
	$$\ce{ KCl +AgNO_{3} -> AgCl v + KNO_{3} {}_{(aq)} }$$

#### Reversible Reactions
Bidirectional reactions, moving in both directions, in which non of the reactants are completely converted into products.

A state called **equilibrium state** is attained at which rate of both forward and backward reactions become equal. 

At equilibrium state, $R_{f} = R_{b}$ where f is forward, b is backward and R is rate. 

![[Reaction rate vs Time.png]]

As a result, concentration of all species involved in reaction also become constant, and they need not be equal. 

![[Pasted image 20230611165438.png]]

At equilibrium thermodynamic parameters like enthalpy change $\Delta H$, entropy change $\Delta S$, internal energy change $\Delta U$ and Gibbs energy change $\Delta G$ become constant. 


All the measurable properties like density, colour etc. remain constant at equilibrium. 

Examples,
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
H_{2} {}_{(g)} + I_{2}  {}_{(g)} &<=> 2HI \\
N_{2} {}_{(g)} + 3H_{2} {}_{(g)} &<=> 2NH_{3} \\
PCl_{5} {}_{(g)} &<=> PCl_{3} {}_{(g)} + Cl_{2} {}_{(g)} \\
2NO_{2} &<=> N_{2}O_{4} \\
H_{2}O {}_{(s)} &<=> H_{2}O {}_{(l)} \\
H_{2}O {}_{(l)} &<=> H_{2}O {}_{(g)} \\
CH_{3}COOH {}_{(l)} + C_{2}H_{5}OH  {}_{(l)} &<=> CH_{3}COOC_{2}H_{5} {}_{(l)} + H_{2}O } \\
\end{split}
 $$

True equilibrium can *only occur* in reversible reactions, and in closed vessel. 

Equilibrium in gas phase is called *Chemical Equilibrium* and in aqueous phase is called *Ionic Equilibrium.*

### Types of Equilibrium 
#### Homogeneous
Equilibrium in which all the reactants and products are in the same phase. 
$$\ce{ N_{2} {}_{(g)} + H_{2} {}_{(g)} <=>2NH_{3} {}_{(g)} }$$

#### Heterogeneous
Equilibrium in which all substances are not in same phase.
1. Phase Change: No chemical changes. 
	$$
	\begin{split}
	\ce{ 
	H_{2}O {}_{(s)} &<=> H_{2}O {}_{(l)} \\
	H_{2}O {}_{(l)} &<=> H_{2}O {}_{(g)} \\
	C_\text{diamond} &<=> C_\text{graphite} \\
	S_\text{rhombic} &<=> S_\text{monoclinc} 
	}
	\end{split}
	$$

1. Chemical Heterogeneous: When there is phase as well as chemical change
	$$
	\begin{split}
	\ce{ 
	CaCO_{3} {}_{(s)} &<=> CaO {}_{(s)} + CO_{2} {}_{(g)} \\
	I_{2} {}_{(s)} + KI {}_{(aq)} &<=> KI_{3} {}_{(aq)} \\
	NH_{4}HS {}_{(s)} &<=> NH_{3} {}_{(g)} + H_{2}S {}_{(g)} 
	}
	\end{split}
	$$

## Characteristics of Equilibrium
- Approach of equilibrium is spontaneous. Equilibrium state is most state of the system and hence it will be attained regardless of the direction of reaction. 
  $\\$

- Addition of catalyst does not affect the state of equilibrium (conc. of P/R), but helps to attain it faster. 
	$\\$

- It is of dynamic nature. It means that both forward and backward reactions proceed at equilibrium state albeit at same rate. So at equilibrium concentration of all species becomes constant. 
  $\\$

- At equilibrium $\Delta G = 0$
  
  Graphically,
  ![[0rvyG.png]]
  
  Gibbs energy of both R and P are equal and minimum and thus $\Delta G = 0$. 

## Vapour Pressure
Pressure exerted by the vapours of a substance (solid or liquid) at equilibrium. 

Most liquids and some solids are volatile at room temp..

A dynamic equilibrium is formed in which rate of evaporation is equal to rate of condensation. 

![[Pasted image 20230617195443.png]]

Vapour pressure is defined only at equilibrium and increases with temp. 
It does not depend on surface area or amount of substance. It is constant for a given substance at a given temp. 

Stronger are the intermolecular forces, lesser will be the escaping tendency and hence lower will be the vapour pressure. 

### Relative Humidity (RH)
It is the amount of water in the air.

$$\ce{ RH = \frac{ p_{H_{2}O(vap)} }{ \text{vapour pressure of} H_{2}O_{(l)} }\times 100 }$$
Where both are measured at same temp conditions.
The denominator is constant at a given temp..

It is a measure of amount of moisture in a gas (or air). 

When partial pressure of $\ce{ H_{2}O_{vap} = VP of H_{2}O }$ then RH becomes 100% and gas (or air) is said to be saturated. A dynamic equilibrium will be established. 

Thus, when RH = 100%, equilibrium exists.

## Thermodynamics of Equilibrium 
**Relation between $k_{eq}$ and $\Delta G_{r}^{o}$**

$$\ce{ aA + bB <=> cC + dD }$$
From thermodynamics,
$$\Delta G_{r} = \Delta G^{o}_{r} + 2.303 RT\log_{10}Q$$
Q is reaction quotient. 

At equilibrium $\Delta G_{r} = 0$  and $Q = k_{eq}$
[[00 Chemical Equilibrium#Characteristics of Equilibrium]]
Thus,
$$0 = \Delta G^{o}_{r} + 2.303RT\log_{10}k_{eq}$$
$$\Delta G^{o}_{r} = -2.303RT\log_{10}k_{eq}$$
Thus, at equilibrium, $\Delta G^{o}_{r}$ need not be zero. It will be zero if $k_{eq}$ is also zero. 

Gibbs energy has another formula,
$$\Delta G^{o}_{r} = \Delta H^{o}_{r} - T\Delta S^{o}_{r} = -2.303RT\log_{10}k_{eq}$$
H is enthalpy, S is entropy.

## Simultaneous Equilibrium 
This case arises when more than 1 equilibrium are in same vessel  *having one or more species common.* 

If one container,
$$\ce{ X {}_{(s)} <=> A {}_{(g)} + B {}_{(g)} }$$
with $k_{p_{1}} = p_{1}^{2}$

In another container,
$$\ce{ Y {}_{(s)} <=> A {}_{(g)} + C {}_{(g)} }$$
with $k_{p_{2}} = p_{2}^{2}$

Now both X and Y are placed in the same vessel under same conditions as before, a simultaneous equilibrium is established, and since the concentration of one of the products (A) is increased, the equilibrium shifts backwards. 

![[Pasted image 20230616214738.png]]

Since the k does not change,
$$k_{p_{1}}= p_{1}^{2} = (p_{1}' + p_{2}') \times p_{1}'$$
$$k_{p_{2}}= p_{2}^{2} = (p_{2}' + p_{1}') \times p_{2}'$$
