# Long form of Periodic table
it was developed by Bohr, Bury, Rang and Werner based on Mosley's Periodic Law.

It consists of 7 horizontal rows which are called **Periods** and 18 vertical columns which are called **Groups.**

The groups were classified as *1A, 2A, 3B, 4B, 5B, 6B, 7B, 8, 1B, 2B, 3A, 4A, 5A, 6A, 7A, Zero*. Which is called **CAS Number** (CAS: Chemical Abstract System). But it is no longer used.

The most fundamental principle of PT is that elements having similar properties should be at similar place, and not the atomic number. The reason why we put He with p-block. 

Nearly 70% of the PT is metals and the rest are non-metals and metalloids.

Formation of PT is based on the filling of the following subshells in the order,
$$\ce{ ns, np, (n-1)d, (n-2)f, (n-3)g, (n-4)h \dots }$$

The periodic table is divided into 4 blocks,
- $s$-block 
	- $ns^{\ 1-2}$
	- Groups: 1 & 2
	- Metals
	- Low density, soft and low to moderate mp
- $p$-block 
	- $[ns^{\ 2}\ np^{\ 1-6}]$
	- Groups: 13 to 18
	- Mostly Non-metals, but also have metalloids and metals
- $d$-block 
	- $(n-1)d^{\ 1-10}\ ns^{\ 0-2}$
	- Groups: 3 to 12
	- Metals
- $f$-block 
	- $(n-2)f^{\ 1-14}\ (n-1)d^{\ 0-1}\ ns^{\ 2}$
	- All $f$-block elements have group number 3.
	- Thus group 3 has 32 elements
	- Metals

Some time ago, the PT was classified as
- Representative elements
	- s & p - block
- Transition elements
	 - d- block 
- Inner-transition elements
	- f-block

Also, 3rd period elements except noble gases are called **Typical Elements.** They consist of groups 1-2, 13-17. 

Some named groups:
- **Noble gases:** gr. 18
- **Halogens:** gr. 17
- **Chalcogens:** gr. 16 (or O family elements)
- **Pnictogens:** gr. 15 (or N family elements)
- **Alkali metals:** gr. 1 
- **Alkaline Earth metals:** gr. 2
