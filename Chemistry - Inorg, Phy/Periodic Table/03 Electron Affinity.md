# Electron Affinity (EA)
**Electron Affinity:** Energy released when an e is added to a gaseous isolated atom to form gaseous anion. It is defined at 0 K. 

For most elements, EA is +ve, i.e. energy is released. But for a few elements, it is -ve, i.e. energy is absorbed (like noble gases, N, Ne, Mg, etc.)

**Electron Gain Enthalpy $(\Delta H_{eg})$:** Enthalpy change when an e is added to 1 mol of gaseous atom to form anion. It is defined at any temp. 

$$EA= -\Delta H_{eg} - \frac{5}{2}RT$$

Thus $\Delta H_{eg}$ is -ve for most elements, but +ve for some cases, like noble gases, N, Be etc..

Energy is released if attraction by nucleus for newly added e is dominant over repulsions caused by existing e. That is EA is +ve and $\Delta H_{eq}$ is -ve. 

$\ce{ X_{(g)} + e^{-} -> X^{-}_{(g)}, EA_{1} = +ve }$ i.e. energy is released.
$\ce{ X-_{(g)} + e- -> X^{2-}_{(g)}, EA_{2} = -ve }$, highly negative, i.e. energy is absorbed.

Adding them,
$\ce{ X{}_{(g)} + 2e- -> X^{2-}{}_{(g)}, EA_{1} + EA_{2} = -ve }$ i.e. energy is absorbed always when a bivalent anion is formed (even for O which has valency 2).

Thus the formation of bivalent anion is always endothermic. 

**Factors Affecting EA:**
1. $\ce{ Z_{eff}\uparrow \implies EA\uparrow }$
2. $\ce{ Size\uparrow \implies EA\downarrow }$
3. Half filled and fully filled config resists the addition of e. This is the reason why EA of noble gases is -ve. I.e. energy will be absorbed if an e is added. 

### Trend in Periodic Table
**Increases along a period.**
**Decreases down a group.**

### Exceptions
1. EA of **Noble Gases, N (only N in N family), Be, Mg** is -ve, i.e. energy is absorbed. 
	The rest all elements have +ve EA. 

2. EA of 3rd period p-block elements is greater than the corresponding 2nd period element (in same group). 
   
   It is due to the exceptionally small size of 2nd period p-block elements like F, O, N etc. in which e density in valence shell is very high, and hence repulsion caused is extremely high. As a result energy released is lesser than expected. 

	$$\ce{ Cl > F, S > O, P > N, Si > C, Al > B }$$
	
	EA of Cl is the highest in the entire PT. 

3. In oxygen family, EA of O is lowest. 
	$$\ce{ S > Se > Te > Po > O }$$
	
	In halogens, Cl is highest followed by F, Br, I.
	$$\ce{ Cl > F > Br > I }$$

4. EA in metals 1st group are greater than 13th group in same period. 
   $$\ce{ Na > Al }$$

**Note:** Lowest IE of an element (like Cs) is greater than the highest EA of  element (like Cl) (magnitude wise). Thus, $\ce{ IE_{Cs} > EA_{Cl} }$

Adding e is always easier. 

## Applications
1. Non metals have high EA values. 

1. Elements which have high EA value act as powerful Oxidising Agent.
    
	Based on EA, it appears that $\ce{ Cl_{2} }$ is the most powerful Oxidising element in PT. However, in aq. medium, $\ce{ F_{2} }$ is the most powerful Oxidising element in PT.
	$$\ce{ OA_{F_{2}} > OA_{Cl_{2}} }$$

	High O power of $\ce{ F_{2} }$ is due to,
	1. Low bond dissociation energy than $\ce{ Cl_{2} }$
	2. High hydration enthalpy of $\ce{ F- }$ due to its small size. 

3. EA values are useful in calculation of [[04 Electronegativity]]  in Millikan's scale.
