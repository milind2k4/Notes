# Periodic Table
Modern or long form of the periodic table is based on **Mosley's Periodic Law**.

**Mosley's Periodic Law:** Properties of elements is the function of atomic number and **not** the atomic mass. i.e. Atomic no. is the fundamental property of elements and not their atomic mass.

#### Experiment Performed by Moseley
He prepared a discharge tube and applied a high voltage difference was created. This creates cathode rays. This excites the e in the metals atoms of the receiver plate. When they transition back they produce x-rays.

By measuring the frequency of these x-rays, Moseley found out that they are dependent on the atomic number and not the atomic mass. 

He developed a relation between frequency and atomic number,
$$\sqrt{ \nu } = a(Z-\sigma)$$
where, 
$a \to$ proportionality constant
$\sigma \to$ shielding constant
$\nu \to$ frequency of x-rays
$Z \to$ atomic number

The frequency of transitions for any two elements are never the same. Like fingerprints. Thus they are the characteristic of every element, which is related with atomic number.

By graphing the curve between $\sqrt{ \nu }$ and atomic number, we can see that it is a straight line.

#### IUPAC Name of Elements with Z $\geq$ 100

Latin name of number is used. And a suffix "-ium" is applied.

| Number | Latin | Abbr. |
| ------ | ----- | ----- |
| 0      | Nil   | N     |
| 1      | Un    | U     |
| 2      | Bi    | B     |
| 3      | Tri   | T     |
| 4      | Quad  | Q     |
| 5      | Pent  | P     |
| 6      | Hex   | H     |
| 7      | Sept  | S     |
| 8      | Oct   | O     |
| 9      | Enn   | E     |

### Predicting Block, Gr. No. and Period
Write e-config of the element. 

Period number is the principal q. no. of outermost shell. 

Block is predicted based on subshell where the last e enters. Common exception is He. 

For group no.,
- s-block: gr. no. = ns e 
- p-block: gr. no. = 10 + (ns + np) e
- d-block: gr. no. = {(n-1)d + ns} e
- f-block: gr. no. = 3


## Shielding Effect
In multi electron species, outer electron experience lesser attractive force due to inner electrons. This is called **Shielding Effect** (or **Screening Effect**) and the inner e are called *Intervening e.* This is due to the inter-repulsion between the e.

Thus, for the outer electrons,
$$Z_{eff} = Z - \sigma$$
where 
$Z \to$ atomic number (number of protons)
$\sigma \to$ shielding constant or screening constant. 

Closer is the intervening e, the greater is the shielding caused. 
$$ns > np > nd > nf$$
Decreasing order of [[04 Probability Distribution#Graphical Comparison of Dist. Func.|penetration power]] and hence of shielding caused. The d & f e are poor shielding e. 

The outer e do not cause shielding.

There is no shielding effect on H atom. i.e. for H, $\sigma = 0$

- **Along a period it increases.**
- **Down a group it increases slightly and may be taken constant.**

2. [[02 Ionisation Enthalpy|Ionisation Enthalpy]]
3. [[03 Electron Affinity|Electron Affinity]]
4. [[04 Electronegativity|Electronegativity]]


### Some Things to Note
1. **For IE,** start from higher and then make a "Z" with arrows, with the arrow coming out of the one which is higher. Keeping exceptions in mind. 
   
   This helps us in comparing IE diagonally.

2. **For EA,** start from the highest and then make a "N" with arrow, with the arrow coming out form the higher one and into the lower. Keeping exceptions in mind,

#### Diagonal Relationship
Some elements behave similar to elements diagonally to them.

![[Pasted image 20230509205026.png]]

**Li and Mg, Be and Al, B and Si** show similar behaviour and properties of their compounds. 
These pairs  are called diagonal relations.

For example, Li and Mg carbonates decompose on heating, but Na carbonates do not,
$$\ce{ Li_{2}CO_{3} ->[\Delta] Li_{2}O + CO_{2} }$$
$$\ce{ MgCO_{3} ->[\Delta] MgO + CO_{2} }$$
$$\ce{ Na_{2}CO_{3} ->[\Delta ] No reaction }$$

$\ce{ BeO \& Al_{2}O_{3} }$ are amphoteric.

Be and Al form carbides of similar nature, both contain $\ce{ C^{4-} }$, $\ce{ Al_{4}C_{3}, Be_{2}C }$

Although other pairs also show diagonal relations, they are too far-fetched to really call them that. 

Diagonal relationship is caused mainly due to
1. Similar ionic potential (i.e. charge/size ratio of corresponding ions i.e. $\ce{ Li+ }$ for Li and $\ce{ Mg^{2+} }$ for Mg)
2. Similar electronegativity

## Inert Pair Effect
This effect is mainly observed in B, C and N family and to some extent O family. These heavier p-block elements show variable OS by a difference of 2. 

For example,
$$\ce{ \underset{ +1,+3 }{ In \& Tl }, \underset{ +2, +4 }{ Sn \& Pb }, \underset{ +3, +5 }{ As, Sb \& Bi } }$$

As we move down, stability of lower OS increases. The heaviest members form stable compounds in lower OS, +1, +2 and +3. 

![[Pasted image 20230509210906.png]]

**Reluctance of ns electrons in the heaviest members to take part in bonding.** The energy required for removal al al of ns e is not compensated by the formation of bond in heaviest elements. Hence this ns pair remains intact. 

#### Applications 
$\ce{ PbO_{2} }$ is a strong OA, as Pb is in +4 and is thus wants to get reduced to +2. 

Similarly $\ce{ SnCl2 }$ is a good RA, as Sn is in +2 which is unstable and wants to get oxidised to +4. 

$\ce{ TlI_{3} }$ (which is $\ce{ Tl+I_{3}- }$ not $\ce{ Tl^{3+} 3I- }$)

$\ce{ PbI_{4} }$ does not exist. Because Pb is in +4 and $\ce{ I- }$ is a good RA. However, $\ce{ PbCl_{4} }$ exists as $\ce{ Cl- }$ is not a good RA. 

$\ce{ FeI_{3} }$ does not exist but $\ce{ FeCl_{3} }$ exist. $\ce{ CuI_{2} }$ does not exist but $\ce{ CuCl_{2} }$ exists. 
These two shows the reducing power of $\ce{ I- }$ ion.
