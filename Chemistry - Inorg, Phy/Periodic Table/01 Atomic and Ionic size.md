# Atomic and Ionic size
## Atomic Radius (or Atomic Size)
The distance between centre of nucleus and outermost e of an atom. But we cannot determine the exact atomic radius as the position of e is uncertain (Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle). And we cannot isolate an atom. 

Indirectly, approx. radius is measured spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction methods i.e. Bonding Data.

Based on this data, we define covalent radius, metallic radius and Vander Waal's radius.

1. Covalent Radius $(r_{cov})$
	- Half of the internuclear distance in a homonuclear diatomic molecule. 
	- Slightly less than actual radius.
	- For heteronuclear molecules, 
	  $$d_{ab} = r_{a} + r_{b} - 0.09|X_{a} - X_{b}|$$
	  this is called **Stevension Formula**
	  where, 
	  $X_{a}, X_{b} \to$ electronegativity on Pauling scale.
	  $r_{a}, r_{b} \to$ radius in $\dot{A}$
	$\\$


2. Metallic Radius $(r_{met})$ (or Crystal Radius)
	- Half of the distance between adjacent atoms in a metallic lattice. 
	- Slightly more than actual radius.
	$\\$


3. Vander Waal's Radius $(r_{van})$
	- Generally used for noble gases.
	- Also called *Non-bonding radius.*
	- In solid/liquid state where atoms are in close proximity, half of the minimum internuclear distance
	- Much more than actual radius. And thus the most inaccurate.
	- We can find Vander Waal's radius for any species

**For the same element,**
$$r_{cov} < r_{met} \ll r_{van}$$

**Factors Affecting Atomic Radius:**
1. Size $\propto \displaystyle \frac{1}{Z_{eff}}$
2. Size $\propto$ Number of shells 

### Trend in Periodic Table
**Decreases along a period.**
**Increases down a group.**

##### Trend in 3d Series elements
First it increase, then becomes nearly constant, then increases slightly. 

The increase is due to the increased repulsion in fully filled d-orbitals.

#### Exceptions
1. In 1st, 2nd and 3rd period, size of noble gases is the largest as Vander Waal's radius is reported while for other noble gases, covalent radius is reported. 
	- However, if we measure size on uniform scale, i.e. V.W radius for all the elements, then there would not be any exception. 

1. $r(Al) > r(Ga)$. Atomic size of Al is slightly larger than Ga.
	- *Reason:* Due to poor shielding caused by the 10 $d$-electrons which are filled into 3d just before Ga (Sc to Zn), and thus the $Z_{eff}$ increases sharply. 

##### Lanthanoid Contraction 
- *Effect:* Elements of 5d series after La are slightly smaller or nearly the same in size as corresponding 4d elements above them.
  $$\ce{ Ti < Zr \approx Hf }$$
- *Reason:*  Due to poor shielding of $f$-electrons, which are filled just after La and just before Hf, $Z_{eff}$ increases sharply. Due to La contraction, the size of elements increases progressively from Ce to Lu

## Ionic Radius
- Cation - smaller than neutral atom $(r(Na^{+}) < r(Na))$
  This is because the outermost e is removed.

- Anion - bigger than neutral atom $(r(F^{-}) > r(F))$
  This is because an e is added into the outermost shell.

Smallest Atom: H
Largest Atom: Cs
Smallest Anion: $\ce{ F- }$ not $\ce{ H- }$
Largest Cation: $\ce{ Cs+ }$ 

This is because,
![[Pasted image 20230505194818.png|400]]

$\ce{ H- }$ is unstable. This is why ionic hydrides $\ce{ LiH, NaH, CaH_{2}, AlH_{3} etc. }$ are powerful reducing agents.

### Isoelectronic Ions
Ions having the same number of e.

For isoelectronic ions,
$$\text{Size} \propto \frac{e}{Z}$$
that is, higher is the Z value, the smaller is the size in isoelectronic species.

#### Note
$$\ce{ r(Li^{+}) > r(Mg^{2+}) }$$

When we move one space to the right of an element, the size increases slightly, when we move one group down, it increases drastically.
