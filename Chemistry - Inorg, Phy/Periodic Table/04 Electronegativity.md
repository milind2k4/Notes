# Electronegativity (EN or $\chi$)

EN of an element is its tendency of an element to **pull shared pair of electron towards itself** in a covalently bonded molecule. It is not a measurable quantity. 

It is not a property of independent atom

The higher the difference in the EN, the more the polarity in covalent bond. 

### Scales of EN
#### Pauling Scale
Pauling gave an empirical formula for difference of EN,
$$x_{A} - x_{B} = 0.208\sqrt{ BE_{A-B} - \sqrt{ BE_{A-A} \times BE_{B-B} } }$$
where
$x_{A}, x_{B} \to$ EN of A and B in Pauling scale
$BE \to$ bond energy in kCal/mol

Pauling assigned EN of H atom 2.1 arbitrarily and calculated EN of various elements,

F = 4.0, Cl = 3.0, O = 3.5, N = 3.0, C = 2.5, H = 2.1 etc

In Pauling Scale, 
*$$\ce{ F > O > N \cong Cl > Br > C \cong S \cong I > H \cong P > B > Na > K > Cs }$$*

F has EN = 4.0 and Cs has EN = 0.7
F is the most EN element in the periodic table, followed by O.

#### Millikan's Scale
According to Millikan, EN of an element is the average of ionisation energy and electron affinity in eV/atom.

$$EN_{M} = \frac{ IE + EA }{ 2 }$$

EN in **Millikan's Scale** = 2.8 $\times$ EN in **Pauling's Scale**.

### Factors affecting EN
1. $\ce{ Z_{eff}\uparrow \implies EN\uparrow }$

1. $\ce{ Size\uparrow \implies EN\downarrow }$

2. $\ce{ +ve\ ON\uparrow \implies EN\uparrow }$
   $\ce{ |-ve\ ON|\uparrow \implies EN\downarrow }$
   $$\ce{ Fe < Fe^{2+} < Fe^{3+} }$$

3. $\ce{ \% s character\uparrow \implies EN\uparrow }$
	$$\ce{ CH_{4} < C_{2}H_{4} < C_{2}H_{2} }$$
	$$\ce{ sp^{3} < sp^{2} < sp }$$
	
	This is due to penetration power of s orbital. 

### Trends in Periodic Table
these trends are of s and p - block.

**Increases along a period.**
**Decreases down a group.**

### Exception
In 13th group (Boron family) EN decreases up to Al and then slightly increases. Meaning EN of Al is the lowest in group 13.

## Applications
#### % ionic character
$\Delta EN \uparrow \implies \text{polarity of covalent bond} \uparrow \implies \% \text{ ionic character} \uparrow$
   
$$\% \text{ ionic character} = 16|x_{A} - x_{B}| + 3.5(x_{A} - x_{B})^{2}$$

when $|x_{A}-x_{B}|=2.1$ then **% ionic character = 50 %**

According to Pauling, if $\Delta EN = 1.7$ then the bond **% ionic character = 50 %**. This is more generally used.

If % ionic character is more than 50 then bond is said to be *predominantly ionic*. If it is less, then bond is said to be *predominantly covalent*. But is also case based.

A **bond never either 100% ionic or covalent.** Even in something like $\ce{ H_{2} }$, there is a miniscule amount of ionic character.

In general, $\Delta EN \uparrow \implies \text{ Strength of bond}\uparrow$
$$\ce{ HF > HCl > HBr > HI  }$$

##### Non-metallic & Metallic Character
$$EN \uparrow \implies \text{non-metallic character} \uparrow\ or\ \text{ electronegative character} \uparrow$$

Thus in s and p-block, in the Periodic Table,

*Metallic character:*
- **Decreases along a period.**
- **Increases down a group.**

*Non-metallic character:*
- **Increases along a period.**
- **Decreases down a group.**

#### Nature of $\ce{ XOH }$ molecule
in Aqueous medium

In general, *polar and ionic compounds are better soluble in polar solvent* like water. The more polar the bond the greater will be its tendency to dissociate in water. 

$$\ce{ XOH ->[+ H_{2}O (l)] X+ + OH- }$$
if X = Na, Rb, Cs, then it behaves as base.

Thus when $\ce{ EN_{X} < EN_{H} }$ it **acts as base.** As the XO bond will be *more polar* than OH bond and thus will break in $\ce{ H_{2}O }$.

$$\ce{ XOH ->[+ H_{2}O (l)] XO- + H+ }$$
if X = Cl, Br, I then it **behaves as acid.**

And when $\ce{ EN_{X} > EN_{H} }$ it behaves as acid. 

Therefore,
$$\ce{ NaOH, KOH, RbOH, CsOH -> Base }$$
$$\ce{ ClOH, BrOH, IOH -> Acid }$$

#### Naming of Compound
The one which is **less EN is written first in molecular formula** in general. 

The element which is **more EN gets "-ide"** added to its name.

#### Determination of Oxidation Number
Determining which element in a molecule will get what charge (has what OS). The one which is more EN will get all the e in the bond when  it is broken.
