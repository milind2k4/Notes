# Oxides and Acids
## Acidic and Basic Nature of Oxides
Oxides are the anhydrides of acids and bases.  
e.g.
$$\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} ->[- H_{2}O] SO_{3} }$$
$\ce{ SO_{3} }$ is an anhydride of sulphuric acid and thus an oxide. 
$$\ce{ 2HNO_{3} ->[-H_{2}O] N_{2}O_{5} }$$
$$\ce{ Ba(OH)2 ->[-H_{2}O] BaO }$$
$$\ce{ 2NaOH ->[-H_{2}O] Na_{2}O }$$

Adding water to oxides generally forms the corresponding acids and bases. 

#### Acidic nature
**Increases along a Period**
**Decreases down a Group**

#### Basic nature
**Decreases along a Period**
**Increases down a Group**

#### Some Trends
$$\ce{ Li_{2}O < Na_{2}O < K_{2}O \dots }$$
increasing acidic nature

$$\ce{ BeO < MgO < CaO < SrO < BaO \dots }$$
increasing basic nature

In 2nd period,
$$\ce{ \underset{ basic }{ Li_{2}O } < \underset{ amphotetic }{ BeO } < \underset{ weak acids }{ B_{2}O_{3} < CO_{2} } < \underset{ strong acid }{ N_{2}O_{5} } }$$
increasing acidic nature.

In 3rd period,
$$\ce{ Na_{2}O < MgO < Al_{2}O_{3} < SiO_{2} < P_{4}O_{10} < SO_{3} < Cl_{2}O_{7} }$$
increasing acidic nature

Their corresponding acids/bases are,
$$\ce{ NaOH , Mg(OH)2 , \underset{ amphoteric }{ Al(OH)3 }, \underset{ weak acid }{ H_{4}SiO_{4} }, H_{3}PO_{4}, H_{2}SO_{4}, HClO_{4}  }$$

In halogens,
$$\ce{ Cl_{2}O > Br_{2}O > I_{2}O }$$
decreasing acidic order

Their corresponding acids,
$$\ce{ ClOH > BrOH > IOH }$$
decreasing acidic nature

### Types of Oxides
1. **Acidic Oxides:** anhydrides of acids and react with base. They are generally oxides of non-metals. 
	
	e.g. $\ce{ SiO_{2}, CO_{2}, P_{4}O_{10}, SO_{2}, N_{2}O_{3}, N_{2}O_{5}, Cl_{2}O_{7} }$ etc

2. **Basic Oxides:** anhydrides of bases and react with acid. Usually oxides of metals
	
	e.g. $\ce{ Na_{2}O, K_{2}O, MgO, BaO, CaO, FeO }$ etc

3. **Amphoteric Oxides:** Which react which both acids and bases
	
	e.g. $\ce{ BeO, Al_{2}O_{3}, ZnO, Cr_{2}O_{3}, Ca_{2}O_{3}, SnO, SnO_{2}, PbO, PbO_{2}, As_{2}O_{3}, As_{2}O_{5} }$ etc

4. **Neutral Oxides:** Don't react with either acid or base
	
	*e.g. $\ce{ CO, N_{2}O, NO }$*

5. **Mixed Oxides:** anhydrides of two acids.
	
	e.g. $\ce{ N_{2}O_{4} (or NO_{2}), ClO_{2} }$
	$$\ce{ HNO_{2} + HNO_{3} ->[-H_{2}O] N_{2}O_{4} }$$
	$$\ce{ HClO_{3} + HClO_{4} ->[-H_{2}O] 2ClO_{2} }$$

When an element forms oxides in multiple oxidation states, then in general,
$$ON\uparrow \implies \text{acidic nature} \uparrow$$

e.g. 

![[acidic nature trend in Mn.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230509200303.png]]

Acidic order:
- $\ce{ SO_{2} < SO_{3} }$
- $\ce{ N_{2}O_{3} < N_{2}O_{5} }$

##### Exception
$$\ce{ \overset{ +3 }{ P }_{4}O_{6} > \overset{ +5 }{ P }_{4}O_{10} }$$
their corresponding acids are,
$$\ce{ H_{3}PO_{3} > H_{3}PO_{4} }$$

## Acids
#### Oxy acids
in which H is attached to O which is further connected to an EN element. 
e.g. $\ce{ H_{2}CO_{3}, H_{2}SO_{4}, H_{3}PO_{4}, HClO_{4}, H_{4}SiO_{4}, HNO_{3} etc }$
Oxy acids form Oxides. The trends in oxy acids are the same as that of oxides. 

Thus,
$$\ce{ H_{4}SiO_{4} < HNO_{3} < H_{2}SO_{4} < HClO_{4} }$$
$$\ce{ H_{3}BO_{3} < H_{2}CO_{3} < HNO_{3} }$$
$$\ce{ HOCl > HOBr > HOI }$$
$$\ce{ HClO_{2} > HBrO_{2} > HIO_{2} }$$
The exceptions are also the same. 

#### Hydra acids
In which H is attached to a highly EN element. 
e.g. $\ce{ HF, HCl, HBr, HI, H_{2}O, H_{2}S, PH_{3} etc }$

It is special as in hydra acids, acidic strength,
**Increases along a period.**
**Increases down a group.**
which is the opposite of strength of Lewis base. 

For example,
In a period,
$$\ce{ CH_{4} < NH_{3} < H_{2}O < HF }$$
$$\ce{ SiH_{4} < PH_{3} < H_{2}S < HCl }$$

In a group,
$$\ce{ NH_{3} < PH_{3} < AsH_{3} < SbH_{3} < BiH_{3} }$$
$$\ce{ HF < HCl < HBr < HI }$$
