# Ionisation Enthalpy 
## Ionisation Energy
Energy needed to remove the most loosely held electron from an isolated gaseous atom to form cation. It is defined at 0 K. 

$$\ce{ M  {}_{(g)} -> M+  {}_{(g)} + e- }$$
Here energy required = IE(M$\ce{{}_{(g)} }$)

**Ionisation Enthalpy:** enthalpy change when one mole of gaseous atoms of an element is converted into gaseous cations. It is defined at any temperature.

$$\ce{ \underset{ 1 mole }{ M  {}_{(g)} } -> M+  {}_{(g)} + e-, \Delta H_{IE} }$$
it is a +ve value, for all elements. Endothermic process.

Relation between IE and $\Delta H_{IE}$
$$\Delta H_{IE} = IE + \frac{5}{2}RT$$
where both $\Delta H_{IE}$ and $IE$ should be taken in $\ce{ J mol^{-1} }$. And R in $\ce{ J K^{-1} mol^{-1} }$

But for all comparisons i.e. trends are interchangeable. 

For an element successive IE goes on increasing.
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
M_{(g)} &->  M^{+}_{(g)} + e^{-}, IE_{1}(M) \\
M^{+}_{(g)} &->  M^{2+}_{(g)} + e^{-}, IE_{2}(M) or IE_{1}(M^{+}) \\
M^{2+}_{(g)} &->  M^{3+}_{(g)} + e^{-}, IE_{3}(M) or IE_{2}(M^{+}) or IE_{1}(M^{2+}) 
 }
\end{split}
$$

$$IE_{1} < IE_{2} < IE_{3} < \dots$$
"Ionisation Energy" means $IE_{1}$.

**Factors affecting:**
- $IE \propto Z_{eff}$
- $IE \propto \displaystyle \frac{1}{Size}$
- Half filled or fully filled configurations are more stable thus IE is more. 
- $IE \propto$ [[04 Probability Distribution#Graphical Comparison of Dist. Func.|Penetration power]] 
	- $ns > np > nd > nf$
	- Removal of $ns$ e takes more energy than $np$

### Trend in Periodic Table
**Increases along a period.**
**Decreases down a group.**

#### Exceptions

1. $\ce{ IE_{Be} > IE_{B} }$
	$\ce{ IE_{Mg} > IE_{Al} }$

	- *Reason:* In $\ce{ Be }$ and $\ce{ Mg }$, e are removed from $2s,3s$ respectively. While in $\ce{ B }$ and $\ce{ Al }$, e are removed from $2p,3p$ respectively. 

2. $\ce{ IE_{N} > IE_{O} }$
	$\ce{ IE_{P} > IE_{S} }$

	- *Reason:* Due to half filled outer e-config. 
	  
2. $\ce{ IE_{Ga} > IE_{Al} }$
	- *Reason:* Size of $\ce{ Ga }$ is less than $\ce{ Al }$.

3. **Lanthanoid Contraction:** After $\ce{ La }$, in the same group, $\ce{ IE_{5d} > IE_{4d}, IE_{5d} > IE_{3d} }$. This extends to p block also, $\ce{ IE_{Pb} > IE_{Sn} }$

## Applications

##### Predicting Metallic Character
aka **Electropositive Character**

$IE \downarrow \implies \text{Mettalic Character} \uparrow$
They quickly lose an electron.

Thus alkali metals in general have greater metallic character than alkaline earth metals. 

- **Metallic character decreases along a period.**
- **Metallic character increases down a group.** 

Elements with low IE form basic oxides in general. Thus oxides of alkali metals are more basic than that of alkaline earth metals. 

Metals with low IE are highly reactive. 
e.g. increasing reactivity,
$\ce{ Li < Na < K < Rb < Cs }$
$\ce{ Be < Mg < Ca < Sr < Ba }$

##### Predicting Reducing/Oxidising Agent
Elements with low IE are powerful reducing agents.

e.g. metals are good RA.

Based on IE, Cs appears to have highest reducing power. However, redox reaction usually occur in aq. medium where other factors like *hydration enthalpy*, ionization energy, sublimation energy also play important role.

**In aq. medium Li is most powerful reducing agent.** It is due to high hydration energy of $\ce{ Li+ }$ ion. 

##### Predicting stable Oxidation State
Values of successive IE gives an idea of stable OS of element.

If successive IE difference is small, then higher oxidation state (or valency) is more stable. If it is small, then lower oxidation state is more stable. 
- If difference is more than 3x, it is large.
