# Empirical and Molecular Formula
### Molecular Formula (MF)
- It gives the actual number of atoms of various elements in the one molecule of a compound.
	- E.g. Glucose: $C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}$

### Empirical Formula (EF)
- It represents the simplest whole number ratio of atoms of various elements in a compound. 
	- E.g. Glucose: $CH_{2}O \implies 1:2:1$ molar ratio

## Relation between EF and MF
- $M.F = (EF)_{n}$
	- where, $n = \displaystyle \frac{\text{Molecuar Formula Weight}}{\text{Empirical Formula Weight}}$

## Determination of EF of a Compound from given Quantitative Analysis
(% by mass of various elements are known)


- **Step-1:** Divide given masses or mass % of various elements by the atomic masses of the elements, this gives relative number of moles.
- **Step-2:** Make these relative number of moles in simplest whole number ratio, you get EF.
