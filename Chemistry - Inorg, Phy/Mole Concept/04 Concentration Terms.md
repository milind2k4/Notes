# Concentration Terms
A solution is a homogeneous mixture of 2 or more components.

It consists of a solute and a solvent. The solute is the minor part and the solvent is the major part.

"A solution of X in Y" implies that X is solute and Y is solvent.

All concentration terms are intensive properties. 

## Concentration Terms
#### % by mass or $\%w/w$
$$\% \frac{w}{w} = \frac{m \text{ of solute}}{m \text{ of solution}} \times 100$$

It does not depend on temperature. 

e.g. 10% w/w aq. Urea solution means that 10 g of Urea is present in 100 g of solution. That is, 90 g is water.  

#### % mass by volume or $\%w/v$
$$\% \frac{w}{v} = \frac{m \text{ of solute}\ (g)}{V \text{ of solution}\ (ml)} \times 100$$

It depends on temperature. T increases $\implies$ %w/v decreases

e.g. 20% w/v aq. $\ce{ CH_{3}COOH }$ means 20 g $\ce{ CH_{3}COOH }$ in 100 ml of solution. To know mass of water in the solution,  we need to know the density.

##### Strength of Solution in g/lit
$$S = \frac{ \text{mass of solute in g} }{ \text{volume of solution in lit} }$$

It is temperature dependent.

#### Molarity or $M$
$$M = \frac{n \text{ of solute}}{V \text{ of solution}\ (l)}$$

It depends on temperature. T increases $\implies$ M decreases

Its unit is mol/lit or Molar

Note: In questions where mass of solute is dissolved in volume of solvent, to find the volume of solution, first find total mass of solution and then find volume of solution using density. 

#### Molality or $m$
$$m = \frac{n \text{ of solute}}{m \text{ of solvent}\ (kg)}$$

It does not depend on temperature.

Its unit is mol/kg or Molal

similarly we have milimolal, centimolal and decimolal. 

e.g. 0.2 molal aq. glucose means 0.2 moles of glucose is present in an aq. solution having solvent water 1 kg. 

Note: when converting molality into molarity, to calculate the volume of solution, first find total mass of solution i.e. n x molar mass + 1 kg, then divide by density. 

Example,

#### M and m of a pure liquid
Molarity of a liquid = no. of moles of liquid in 1 litre of liquid.
Molality of a liquid = no. of moles of liquid in 1 kg of liquid.

For example for water,
$$M = \frac{ 1000 / 18\ mol }{ 1\ lit } = 55.55 \ce{\ molar }$$
$$m = \frac{ 1000 / 18\ mol }{ 1\ kg } = 55.55 \ce{\ molal }$$

For ethanol with density 0.9,

#### Mole Fraction or $x$
$$x_{A} = \frac{\text{No of moles of A}}{\text{Total moles}} = \frac{n_{A}}{n_{T}}$$

$$\sum x_{A} = 1$$

It does not depend on temperature.

It is unitless. 

Converting mole fraction into molality,

#### Parts Per million or ppm
$$ppm = \frac{m \text{ of solute}}{m \text{ of solution}} \times 10 ^{6}$$

#### Parts Per billion or ppm
$$ppb = \frac{m \text{ of solute}}{m \text{ of solution}} \times 10 ^{9}$$

They are used when the solution is very dilute. 
Both do not depend on temperature. 

## Mixing of Solution

In ionic solutions, the molarity of the ion is the molarity of the solution times the number of that ion in the solute. We don't consider $\ce{ H+ \&\ OH- }$ coming from water. Also, ppt does not contribute to ions in the solution. 

If there is mixture of 2 or more solutions we use the basic formula.

Find the number of moles of the required constituent and the total volume of the solution. 

For neutralizing reaction mixing,

Find the LR, then write the balanced reaction. Find which of the products and reactants remain after the reaction. Find the molarity of those. 

We can also calculate in milimoles.

When there is water of crystallization and water is solvent, the WoC comes out and gets added to the solvent.

When density of solution as well as of solute and solvent, we need to find the volume of solution of using that data,
