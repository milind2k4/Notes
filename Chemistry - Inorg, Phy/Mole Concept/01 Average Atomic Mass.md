# Average Atomic Mass or Average isotopic mass
In stoichiometric calculations, average atomic mass of elements are used. 

### Isotope
Species having the same atomic number but different mass number of an element.

$\ce{ _{1}H^{1},\ _{1}H^{3},\ _{1}H^{3} }$
$\ce{ _{1}H^{3} }$ is radioactive.

$\ce{ _{6}C^{12},\ _{6}C^{14} }$
$\ce{ _{6}C^{14} }$ is radioactive.

$\ce{ {}^{16}_{8}O, {}^{17}_{8}O, {}^{18}_{8}O }$

$\ce{ {}^{17}_{35}Cl, {}^{37}_{17}Cl }$

Average Mass  
- = Total mass of all the atoms in the sample / Total number of atoms, amu
- = Total mass in g / Total no of moles, g/mol

## % by mole abundance of isotopes is given

For 2 isotopes,

$$M_{av} = \frac{x \times M_{a} + (100-x) \times M_{b}}{100}$$

where the bottom 100 is the sum of %s of the isotopes. 

For more than 2 isotopes,
$$M_{av} = \frac{x_{1}M_{1} + x_{2}M_{2} + x_{3}M_{3}+....}{100}$$

where $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}...$ are %s by mole of various isotopes and $M_{1}, M_{2}, M_{3}...$ are the molar masses.

- **In a mixture, % by mol of a component need not be same as % by mass of that component.**

#### Relation b/w % by mol and % by mass
$$\% \text{ by mass of A} = \% \text{ by mole of A} \times \frac{ M_{A} }{ M_{av} }$$

$$\begin{split}
& = \frac{\text{Mass of A}}{\text{Total Mass}} \\\\
& = \frac{x * M_{A}}{x*M_{A} + (100 - x)* M_{B}} \times 100 \\\\
& = x \times \frac{M_{A}}{\left\{ \frac{x*M_{A} + (100 - x)* M_{B}}{100} \right\}} \\\\
& = x \times \frac{M_{A}}{M_{av}} \\\\
& = \text{\% by}\ mol_{(A)} \times \frac{M_{A}}{M_{av}}
\end{split}$$


### When molar ratio of Isotopes is given
   
![[Molar ratio of Isotopes.png]]
   
$$M_{av} = \frac{m * M_{A} + n * M_{B}}{m+n}$$

This is also when %s by mole are given. Just have to convert the given %s into m and n.

And we can convert molar ratio into % by moles as well,
$$\ce{ \% by mol of A = \frac{ m }{ m+n } \times 100 }$$
$$\ce{ \% by mol of B = \frac{ n }{ m+n } \times 100 }$$

### Density and Molar mass relation
$$
\begin{split}
PV &= nRT \\
PV &= \frac{m}{M}RT \\
PM &= \frac{m}{V}RT \\
PM &= d_{g}RT \\
d_{g} &\propto M \\  
\end{split} 
$$

In case of Mixture of gases,
$$d_{g} \propto M_{av}$$

Under same $\text{P \& T}$,
- If we add a gas of molar mass less than $M_{av}$ , $M_{av}$ decreases, and thus the density falls
- If we add a gas of molar mass more than $M_{av}$ , $M_{av}$ increases, and thus the density rises.


**For a closed System:**
$M_{T}$ is constant, thus
 $$M_{av} = \frac{\text{Total Mass}}{Total Moles} \implies \frac{Constant}{n_{T}}$$
 Thus,
$$M_{av} \propto \frac{1}{n_{T}}.$$

For gasses in a mixture, % by volume of a gas is equal to the % by mole of gas in closed system.
