# Chemical Stoichiometry
It involves calculations of amount of reactants/products involved in a chemical reaction.

$$\ce{ 2A + 3B -> C + 2D }$$
If this is a balanced reaction it means that 2 moles of A react completely with 3 moles of B to form 1 mole of C and 2 moles of D

Here, 2, 3, 1 and 2 are stoichiometric coefficient and read in moles. I.e. 2,3,1 and 2 are moles. 

It is read as, 2 moles of A reacts with 3 moles of B and forms 1 mole of C and 2 moles of D.

In Stoichiometry questions, first write the balanced the reaction and then use unitary method. 

Unless stated in the question, always check balancing. 

At STP, to find volume of water, first find the mass of water, then use density given in the question or use $\ce{ d = 1 g/ml }$

- When solving Mixture questions, write the equations separately and then solve.

### Factor Label Method
Useful when product is obtained by sequential reactions. 

$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
2A + 3B &-> C + 2D \\
D + 2E &->  4F \\
3F + Y &-> 2Z
 }
\end{split}
$$
Here D and F are intermediates. To go from one reaction to another, we go through intermediates. 
If all are balanced, and other than A and Z all are in excess, then to find mass of Z obtained,
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
\frac{w}{M_{A}} &-> moles of A \\
\frac{w}{M_{A}}\times \frac{2}{2} &-> moles of D \\
\frac{w}{M_{A}}\times \frac{2}{2}\times \frac{4}{1} &-> moles of F \\
\frac{w}{M_{A}}\times \frac{2}{2}\times \frac{4}{1}\times \frac{2}{3} &-> moles of Z
 }
\end{split}
$$

## Limiting Reagent
aka Limiting Reactant

When 2 or more reactants are involved in a reaction, the one which gets consumed first is the Limiting Reagent. The one which remains at the end is the excess reactant. 

The reaction goes on till the LR is exhausted. Thus the amount of product should be calculated on the basis of LR.

If all the reactants are completely consumed, then none are LR. 
In this case, the reactants are said to be in stoichiometric amounts. 

### How to find LR

1. Write the balanced reaction and calculate no of moles of all reactants. 
1. Divide given no of moles of reagent by their st coefficient and obtain the ratio.
3. The one with the least ratio is the LR. 

To find the mass of excess reactant left, use conservation of mass. 
Excess Left = Mass of Reactants - Mass of Product Formed

To find composition, find LR, then calculate the reactants left and products formed on it's basis. 

## Heating Effects

$$\ce{ Li_{2}CO_{3} -> Li_{2}O + CO_{2} }$$
Other than Li other Alkali metals do not decompose on heating.
$$\ce{ M_{2}CO_{3} ->[\Delta] No decomposition [M \to Na / K / Rb / Cs] }$$

$$\ce{ MCO_{3} -> MO + CO_{2} }$$
M $\to$ Be/Mg/Ca/Sr/Ba/Pb/Cu etc. 

$$\ce{ 2NaHCO_{3}\ (s) -> Na_{2}CO_{3}\ (s) + H_{2}O\ (g) + CO_{2}\ (g) }$$
$$\ce{ 2NaHCO_{3}\ (aq) -> Na_{2}CO_{3}\ (aq) + H_{2}O\ (l) + CO_{2}\ (g) }$$

$$\ce{ M(NO_{3})_{2}\ (s) -> MO\ (s) + NO_{2}\ (g) + O_{2}\ (g) }$$
M $\to$ Cu/Pb/Mg/Ca

Some compounds and salts are insoluble in water. They remain as precipitate (ppt);
$$\ce{ CaCO3, BaSO_{4}, AgCl, AgBr, AgI, PbI_{2}, etc. }$$
Colour of some of them are:

| Ppt.                | dil. aq. $\ce{ NH_{3} }$ | conc. aq. $\ce{ NH_{3} }$ | aq. $\ce{ KCN }$ | aq.  hypo $\ce{ Na_{2}S_{2}O_{3} }$ |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| AgCl (white)        | dissolves                | dissolves                 | dissolves        | dissolves                           |
| AgBr (dull yellow)  |  -                        | dissolves                 | dissolves        | dissolves                           |
| AgI (bright yellow) |  -                        |      -                     | dissolves        | dissolves                                    |

AgCl dissolves in ammonia by [[00 Ionic Equilibrium#Complexation Equilibrium|forming complex]], 
$$\ce{ AgCl v + 2NH_{3} -> [Ag(NH_{3})2]+ {}_{(aq)} + Cl- }$$

Similarly for AgBr and AgI
$$\ce{ AgBr v + 2KCN -> 2K+ + [Ag(CN)2]- + Br- }$$
$$\ce{ AgI v + 2Na_{2}S_{2}O_{3} -> [Ag(S_{2}O_{3})2]^{3-} + 2Na+ }$$
Thiosulphae is [[02 Types of Ligands#Flexidentate Ligand|flexidentate]] ligand and here it acts as monodentate ligand. 

#### Some more heating effects
$$\ce{ KClO_{3} ->[\Delta] KCl + 3/2O_{2} }$$

## % Yield of Reaction
$$
\% \text{ yield of reaction} = \frac{\text{Amount of a product actually formed}}{\text{Theoretical amount formed }} \times 100
$$
Theoretical amount formed = Stoichiometric amount obtainable

The % written above arrow in a reaction is the % yield. 

The maximum value of % yield is 100%.

## Principle of Atom Conservation
Based on Law of Conservation of Mass.
Balancing of Reaction is not needed.

No. of atoms of any element of reactants will be equal to no of atoms of that element in products if this element is completely converted into products.

**It should be carefully applied on that element which is completely converted into product.** 
i.e. only apply it to LR. 


Number of moles of atom (not molecules i.e. take $\ce{ O }$ not $\ce{ O_{2} }$) in reactants = number of moles of atom in product.

If not sure whether to use POAC or not, don't. 

![[Pasted image 20230420201407.png]]

![[Example POAC.png]]

While applying POAC, write all the reactants to the left side and all products to the right side. i.e. writing different reactions is not required. 

![[Pasted image 20230420203235.png]]

When 2 elements react to form two or more compounds of varied composition, then both the reactants are completely consumed, and hence we can apply POAC.
