# Mole Concept
#### Relative Atomic Mass
Mass of one atom of an element wrt 1 amu (or 1 u)
- 1 u = $\displaystyle \frac{1}{12}$ of mass of 1 atom of C-12 isotope.
- 1 u = $1.66 \times 10^{-24}$ g

It is dimensionless.

#### Atomic Mass
Mass of 1 atom of an element in amu.

#### Gram Atomic Mass
Mass of 1 mole of atoms of an element.
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
&= RLM \times N_{a} \\
&= RLM \times 1.66 \times 10^{-24} \times 6.022\times 10^{24} \\
&= RLM g/mol 
}
\end{split}
$$

### Mole
Amount of substance which contain as many entities as the number of atoms in 12 g of C-12 isotope

1 mol = $6.022 \times 10^{23}=$  Avogadro Number ($N_a$)

#### STP (Std T & P) or NTP (Normal T & P)
P = 1 bar & T = 0$^\circ$ or 273.15 K

Molar Volume of gas at $\ce{ STP = 22.4  l mol^{-1} }$ a/c old definition of STP/NTP
  - Old definition says **P = 1 atm** and T = 0$^\circ$

Molar Volume of gas at $\ce{ STP = 22.7  l mol^{-1} }$ a/c new definition of STP/NTP
  - New definition says P = 1 bar (which is slightly less than 1 atm) and T = 0$^\circ$
  - If nothing else is given then assume new definition.

If gas is not under STP/NTP use **PV = nRT** (ideal gas equation) to find **n**

### Calculation of Number of Moles
1. When number of particles are given:
	- No of moles = given number of particles / $N_a$
    - We can use $6 \times 10^{23}$ for calculations.

2. When mass of Substance is given:
	- No of moles = given mass (in g) / molar mass (in g/mol)

3. For gases, if V of gases is given under STP or NTP conditions:
	- No of moles = given V of gas (in l) / molar V of gas (in l/mol)
	- No of moles = $\displaystyle \frac{(V_{gas})^{STP}\ (l)}{22.7\ mol/l }$

#### Atomicity
Number of atoms in one molecule. (mono, dia, tria, poly - atomic.)

### Ideal Gas Equation
For an ideal gas,
$$PV = nRT$$
where, R is Universal Gas Constant
- $= 0.0821 \approx \displaystyle \frac{1}{12}$ $\ce{ l\ atm\ mol^{-1} K^{-1} }$ (use if P is given in atm)
- $= 8.314 \approx \displaystyle \frac{25}{3}$  $\ce{ J\  mol^{-1} K^{-1} }$ (SI)   (use if P in Pascal and V in $\text{m}^{-3}$)
- $\approx \ce{ 2 cal mol^{-1} K^{-1} }$

Now, 
$$
\begin{split}
PV &= \frac{w}{M}RT \\
PM &= \frac{w}{V}RT \\
PM &= dRT
\end{split}
$$

From here, we can see that,
$$d \propto M$$
where $d$ is density and $M$ is molar mass of gas. 
Thus, dry air is denser than moist air. This is because water is lighter than the $M_{av}$ of dry air which is 28.8 g/mol. Thus, when we add water to air, $M_{av}$ decreases. 

For a gas mixture, 
$$PM_{av} = d_{mix}RT$$

### Relative density
It is a dimensionless term. 

It is of two types, 
- **Specific Gravity:** 
  $$\displaystyle \frac{ \text{density of substance} }{ \text{density of water at 4}^{\circ}\ C } = \frac{ d_{sub} \text{ in g/ml} }{ 1 \text{ g/ml} }$$
  It is used for solids and liquids. 
  It is inversely proportional to T.
   
- **Vapour density:** 
  $$\displaystyle \frac{ \text{density of gas} }{ \text{density of reference gas} }$$
  It is defined only for gases. Both should be at the same P and T.
  If it is not mentioned then the reference gas is $\ce{ H_{2} }$. 
  
  Thus, $$\ce{ VD_{g} = \frac{ density of gas }{ density of H_{2} gas } }$$
  
  And since $d_{g} \propto M_{g}$,
  $$VD_{g} = \frac{ M_{g} }{ M_{H_{2}} } = \frac{ M_{g} }{ 2 }$$
  VD is temperature independent. 
  
  For a mixture, 
  $$VD_{g} = \frac{ M_{av} }{ 2 }$$

## Determination of min. molar mass of compound
There should be **at least one** atom of that element in the compound.
