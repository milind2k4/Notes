# Oxygen Family 
O, S are non metals, Selenium (Se), Tellurium (Te) are metalloids and Polonium (Po) is radioactive metal. 

O is the most abundant element on earth. 

All elements show allotropy.

Heavier members show +4 and +6 OS. And as we move down, stability of +4 OS increases due to inert pair effect. 

mp and bp increase down the group. 

### Reactivities 
#### Reactivity towards H 
$$\ce{ H_{2}O, H_{2}S, H_{2}Se, H_{2}Te }$$

Similar to [[02 Nitrogen Family#Reactivity towards H|hydrides of N,]] other than $\ce{ H_{2}O }$, all have bond angles around 90 and do not show hybridisation according to Drago's Rule. 

As we move down the group, acidic nature and reducing nature increases while thermal stability decreases. 
$\ce{ H_{2}Te }$ is least thermally stable,
$$\ce{ H_{2}Te ->[\Delta] H_{2} ^ + Te }$$

Other than $\ce{ H_{2}O }$ which is liquid due to H boning, all are gases at room temp..

Decreasing bp,
$$\ce{ H_{2}O > H_{2}Te > H_{2}Se > H_{2}S }$$
Water shows exception due to [[12 Hydrogen Bonding|H bonding.]]

#### Reactivity towards O
$$\ce{ EO_{2}, EO_{3} (E \to S, Se, Te) }$$

As we go down a group, oxidising nature increases,
$$\ce{ SO_{2} < SeO_{2} < TeO_{2} }$$

$\ce{ SO_{2} }$ is primarily a RA. However, it can act as OA also. 
$\ce{ TeO_{2} }$ is a good OA. 

+6 OS oxides are powerful OA.
$$\ce{ SO_{3}, SeO_{3}, TeO_{3} }$$

And $\ce{ SO_{2} }$ is more acidic than $\ce{ SO_{3} }$.
Generally, the oxide in higher OS is more acidic than the one in lower OS.

#### Reactivity Towards Halogens 
$$\ce{ EX_{2}, EX_{4}, EX_{6} }$$

$\ce{ SCl_{6} }$ does not exist because S is small and 6 Cl which is of large size are not stable on it. 

Among hexahalides, only hexa fluorides are stable. All are gaseous. 

All elements except Selenium form dichlorides and dibromides. 

Mono chlorides are dimeric and undergo disproportionation. 
$$\ce{ 2Se_{2}Cl_{2} -> SeCl_{4} + 3Se }$$

$\ce{ S_{2}F_{2} }$ has open book like non planar structure,

### Dioxygen 
#### Preparation 
It can be prepared by heating $\ce{ KClO_{3} }$ (pot. chlorate) with $\ce{ MnO_{2} }$ catalyst,
$$\ce{ KClO_{3} ->[MnO_{2}][\Delta] KCl + O_{2} ^ }$$

**By Thermal Decomposition:**

Large scale production is done by fractional distillation of air.

**Hydrolysis of Water:** [[08 Electrolytic Cell]]

**Brins' Process** produces very pure $\ce{ O_{2} }$. 
$$\ce{ BaO + O_{2}(air) ->[500 ^{\circ}C] \underset{ peroxide }{ BaO_{2} } ->[800 ^{\circ}C] BaO + O_{2}_{(g)} (pure) }$$

It can also be obtained from oxygen rich oxides, $\ce{ MnO_{2}, PbO_{2} }$. 
$$\ce{ MnO_{2}, PO_{2} + conc. H_{2}SO_{4}, conc. HNO_{3} ->[\Delta] O_{2} ^ + Mn^{2+}, Pb^{2+} }$$

#### Properties 
Colourless, odourless, tasteless , paramagnetic gas which supports combustion. Little soluble in water. 

It reacts with almost all metals. Except Pt and Au.

### Sulphur
#### Allotropes of Sulphur 
There are two allotropes of S, *Rhombic* and *Monoclinic (aka $\beta$-S).* Both have formula $\ce{ S_{8} }$.

On heating rhombic, it converts to monoclinic. At 369 K, they are at equilibrium. 
$$\ce{ S_{r} <=>[369 K] S_{m} }$$

$\ce{ S_{r} }$ exists at room temp. and is most stable form of S. It has $\Delta H^{o}_{f}(S_{r}) = 0$.

Both are yellow and crown like structure.

$\ce{ S_{r} }$ is insoluble in water but soluble in $\ce{ CS_{2} }$. 

Bore hole method (Frasch Process) is used to mine S from the earth's crust.

**Plastic Sulphur:** Formed when molten S is poured in liquid water (cold). It consists of chain like molecule and has rubber like properties. 
However, on standing, it converts to $\ce{ S_{r} }$. 

**Roll Sulphur:** Molten S is cast into solid rods or sticks. 

**Flower of Sulphur:** Sublimed and deposited powdered form of S. 

**Milk of Sulphur:** Precipitated form of S. It is used in skin medicines. 

All of the above have formula $\ce{ S_{8} }$.

Gunpowder has composition,
$$\ce{ NaNO_{3} (75\%) + Charcoal(15\%) + Sulphur(10\%) }$$
