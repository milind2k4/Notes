# Halogen and Noble Gases 
## Halogens 
Group 17. After I, there is Astatine (At) which is radioactive. 

Under room temp.,
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
F_{2} &: Yellow Gas \\
Cl_{2} &: Greenish Yellow Gas \\
Br_{2} &: Red Liquid \\
I_{2} &: Violet Solid
 }
\end{split}
$$

All are non metals and none show allotropy. 

**[[03 Electron Affinity|e affinity,]]**
$$\ce{ Cl > F > Br > I }$$

##### Bond energy and Bond length
**Bond energy,**
$$\ce{ Cl_{2} > Br_{2} > F_{2} > I_{2} }$$
F-F bond is weak because of heavy repulsion b/w lp on small sized F atoms. 

**Bond length,**
$$\ce{ I_{2} > Br_{2} > Cl_{2} > F_{2} }$$

##### Oxidation and Reducing Power
**Oxidising power,**
$$\ce{ F_{2} > Cl_{2} > Br_{2} > I_{2} }$$

**Reducing power,**
$$\ce{ I- > Br- > Cl- }$$

Nothing can convert $\ce{ F- }$ to $\ce{ F_{2} }$. 
$\ce{ F_{2} }$ is more powerful oxidising element than $\ce{ Cl_{2} }$ because,
1. F-F BE is low. 
2. Hydration enthalpy of $\ce{ F-_{(g)} }$ is very high due to its small size.

##### OS and Reactivity 
**Oxidation States,**
Halogens (except F) show a wide variety of OS. Ranging from -1 to +7. 

F shows only -1 or 0. 

Other halogens can show -1, 0, +1, +3, +5, +7. 

**Reactivity,**
$$\ce{ F_{2} > Cl_{2} > Br_{2} > I_{2} }$$

##### Sources of Halogen 
Halogens are found in many ores.

### Fluorine 
#### Preparation 
By electrolysis of $\ce{ K[HF_{2}] }$.

#### Properties 
Fluorine oxidises almost everything and it is highly reactive.

### Chlorine 
#### Preparation

##### Large Scale Production
**Deacon's Process** is catalytic oxidation of HCl by air. Catalyst is $\ce{ CuCl_{2} }$ and the temp. is 723 K. 

Electrolysis of conc. NaCl solution (Brine solution).

#### Properties 
It is a greenish yellow gas and a powerful OA. 

On reaction with $\ce{ NH_{3} }$, if ammonia is taken in excess, $\ce{ N_{2} }$ is formed. However, if $\ce{ Cl_{2} }$ is taken in excess, $\ce{ NCl }$ is formed which is an explosive compound.

[[00 GIC#Disproportionation Reaction]]

Composition of Bleaching powder,
$$\ce{ Ca(OCl)2 . CaCl_{3} . Ca(OH)2 . 2H_{2}O }$$
And it is the source of $\ce{ Cl_{2} }$. 
$$\ce{ CaOCl_{2} + H_{2}O -> CaCl_{2} + HOCl -> CaCl_{2} + HCl + O }$$
This nascent O is responsible for the bleaching effect. 

##### Uses of Chlorine 
1. Bleaching wood, pulp or fabric.
2. Extraction of Au/Pt. 
3. Manufacturing of $\ce{ CCl_{4}, CHCl_{3}, DDT, freons etc. }$
4. Sterilising water.
5. Making poisonous gases like phosgene ($\ce{ COCl_{2} }$), tear gas ($\ce{ CCl_{3}NO_{2} }$).

## Noble Gases 
All are monoatomic, colourless, odourless and tasteless gases which are very little soluble in water. 

All are present in air except Rn in a very little amount. Ar is the most abundant noble gas in air. 

Rn is radioactive. 

Lowest mp and bp is of He (bp of He is around 4.3 K). Thus it is the most difficult to liquify. 

Neil Bartlet observed that $IE_{1}$ of $\ce{ O_{2} }$ and Xe are nearly equal.

Since $\ce{ O_{2} }$ forms compound with $\ce{ PtF_{6} }$, i.e. $\ce{ O_{2}+PtF_{6}- }$(red), then why not Xe. 

He prepared finally a compound of Xe, $\ce{ Xe+PtF_{6}- }$. Thus breaking the conception that noble gases cannot form compounds.

Now so many compounds of Xe have been prepared. $\ce{ XeF_{2}, XeF_{4}, XeO_{3}, XeO_{4}, XeOF_{2} }$.

However, He, Ne and Ar still do not have any compounds. 

#### Uses of Noble Gases 
1. He is a non inflammable, light gas used in gas cooled nuclear reactors and diving apparatus (breathing air is diluted with He to minimise bends)
2. He is used for cryogenic experiments due to very low bp. 
3. He is also used for making super conducting magnets (used for MRI).
4. Ne is used in discharge tubes and fluorescent bulbs. 
5. Ar is used to make inert atmosphere for metallurgic operations and arc welding and is used in electric bulbs. 
6. Kr and Xe are used in light bulbs  designed for special purposes.
