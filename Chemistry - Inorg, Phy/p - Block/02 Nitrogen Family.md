# Nitrogen Family 
The outer e config is $ns^{2} np^{3}$. 
They show a large variety of OS. 

![[Pasted image 20240301144333.png]]

N, P are non metals; As (Arsenic), Sb (Antimony) are metalloids and Bi is metal. 

N has two table isotopes, $\ce{ {}^{14}N \& ^{15}N }$

**Inert Pair Effect:** Reluctance of ns e to take part in bond formation is called inert pair effect. 

This effect is dominant as we go down a group. The heaviest elements of B, C, N and O family show lower OS as their stable OS.

![[Pasted image 20240301144622.png]]

Except $\ce{ N_{2} }$, all the elements are stable at room temp. $\ce{ N_{2} }$ is a gas. 
This is also supported by the fact that P and As form tetra atomic molecules, $\ce{ P_{4}, As_{4} }$ and thus have more intermolecular forces. 

Except $\ce{ N_{2} }$, all other elements show allotropy. #important 

mp increases from N to As and then decreases to Bi. 
$$\ce{ N < P < As > Sb > Bi }$$

Metallic character increases from top to bottom,
$$\ce{ \underset{ non metals }{ N < P } < \underset{ metalloids }{ As < Sb } < \underset{ metal }{ Bi } }$$

##### Disproportionation 
Oxyacids of N and P in intermediate OS undergo disproportionation. [[00 GIC#Disproportionation Reaction]]
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
HNO_{2} &-> HNO_{3} + NO ^ \\
H_{3}PO_{2} &->[\Delta] H_{3}PO_{3} + PH_{3} ^ \\
H_{3}PO_{3} &->[\Delta] H_{3}PO_{4} + PH_{3} ^
 }
\end{split}
$$

##### Exceptional Behaviour 
2nd period p block elements shows exceptional behaviour from rest of the elements in the group due to,
1. Unavailability of d orbitals in valence shell, hence their max. covalency is 4. 
2. Small Size
3. High EN.

![[Pasted image 20240301145518.png]]

##### Bond Strength 
Single N-N bond is weaker than single P-P bond. 
Single O-O bond is weaker than single S-S bond. 
Single F-F bond is weaker than single Cl-Cl bond. 

This is due to heavy repulsions caused by lp present on small sized 2nd period elements. 

$\ce{ N_{2}_{(g)} }$ is considered an inert gas as it is less reactive due to high bond energy of $\ce{ N#N }$. 

### Reactivities
#### Reactivity towards H
All the elements of group 15 show reactivity towards H and form hydrides. 

$$\ce{ NH_{3}, PH_{3}, AsH_{3}, SbH_{3}, BiH_{3}  }$$

Acidic nature increases from top to bottom. Thus $\ce{ PH_{3} }$ is a better lewis acid than $\ce{ NH_{3} }$. 

Reducing nature also increases down the group because of weaker E-H bond.

$\ce{ NH_{3} }$ has bond angles close to 107 degrees, and the others do not show hybridisation and thus have bond angles close to 90 deg. This is [[08 Hybridisation#Drago's Rule]]

$\ce{ NH_{3} }$ is the most thermally stable. 
$\ce{ BiH_{3} }$ is least thermally stable because of large size of Bi and long bond lengths. 
On heating.
$$\ce{ BiH_{3} ->[\Delta] Bi  {}_{(s)} + H_{2} }$$

Boiling point order,
$$\ce{ BiH_{3} > SbH_{3} > NH_{3} > AsH_{3} > PH_{3} }$$
$\ce{ NH_{3} }$ has H-bonding and thus its bp is not the lowest.

#### Reactivity towards O
All elements of gr 15 react with O. 

The oxide with more OS is more acidic. 
e.g. $\ce{ N_{2}O_{5} > N_{2}O_{3} }$
**Except, $\ce{ P_{4}O_{6} > P_{4}O_{10} }$**

Acidic nature of oxides decreases down the group. 

![[Pasted image 20240301150639.png]]

As and Sb form amphoteric oxides. Bi forms basic oxides. 

Oxides of N,
$$\ce{ \underbrace{ N_{2}O, NO }_{ neutral }, \underbrace{ N_{2}O_{3}, N_{2}O_{4} or NO_{2}, N_{2}O_{5} }_{ acidic } }$$

#### Reactivity towards Halogens 
$$\ce{ EX_{3}, EX_{5} (E \to P, As, Sb) }$$
Thus +3 and +5 OS are shown. 

$\ce{ NX_{3} }$ does not exist as N can't expand its octet. 

$\ce{ NF_{3} }$ is stable. $\ce{ NCl_{3} }$ is explosive and $\ce{ NBr_{3}, NI_{3} }$ are known only in their unstable ammoniates, e.g. $\ce{ NBr_{3}.6NH_{3}, NI_{3}.6NH_{3} }$.

All trihalides of the N family except $\ce{ BiF_{3} }$ are covalent. $\ce{ BiF_{3} }$ is ionic.

#### Reactivity towards Metals
All of them react with metal to form binary compounds exhibiting -3 OS. 

Hydrolysis of nitrides give ammonia, phosphines gives phosphene and so on.

$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
Ca_{3}N_{2} + H_{2}O &-> NH_{3} ^ + Ca(OH)2 \\
Ca_{3}P_{2} + H_{2}O &-> PH_{3} ^ + Ca(OH)2 \\
Na_{3}As + H_{2}O &-> \underset{ arsene }{ AsH_{3} } ^ + NaOH \\
Na_{3}Sb + H_{2}O &-> \underset{ stibine }{ SbH_{3} } ^ + NaOH
}
\end{split}
$$

### Dinitrogen
#### Preparation
Prepared by treating an aq solution of $\ce{ NH_{4}Cl }$ with $\ce{ NaNO_{2} }$,
$$\ce{ NH_{4}Cl {}_{(aq)} + NaNO_{2}  {}_{(aq)} -> N_{2} + 2H_{2}O + NaCl {}_{(aq)} }$$

Can also be obtained by heating ammonium dichromate (used in fireworks),
$$\ce{ \underset{ orange }{ (NH_{4})2C_{r}2O_{7} } -> N_{2} + 2H_{2}O + \underset{ green }{ Cr_{2}O_{3} } }$$

It can also be obtained by heating ammonium per chlorate,
$$\ce{ NH_{4}ClO_{4} -> N_{2} + H_{2}O + Cl_{2} + O_{2} }$$

Very pure N can be obtained by thermal decomposition of metal azides,
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
Ba(N_{3})2 &-> Ba + 3N_{2} \\
NaN_{3} &-> Na + N_{2} \\
}
\end{split}
$$
$\ce{ Ba(N_{3})2 \& NaN_{3} }$ are used in explosives.

**From ammonia:**
![[Pasted image 20240301151721.png]]

Large scale production is done by fractional distillation of air. It is also used for large scale production of $\ce{ O_{2} }$.

#### Properties
It is a colourless, odourless, tasteless and non-toxic gas. It is neither combustible, for supports it.

Dinitrogen is inert at room temp because of high bond enthalpy of $\ce{ N#N }$ bond. 
However, reactivity increases with rise in temp. 

At high temps it combines directly with metals to form ionic nitrides,
$$\ce{ 6Li + N_{2} -> 2Li_{3}N }$$
$$\ce{ 3Mg + N_{2} -> 2Mg_{3}N }$$
They on hydrolysis liberates ammonia and forms hydroxides of Li and Mg. 

Nitrogen is reacted with hydrogen to form ammonia. This is called **Haber's Process.**

$$\ce{ N_{2} + 3H_{2} ->[500^{\circ}C][200 atm] 2NH_{3}, \Delta H = -ve }$$
It is an exothermic process.

Iron is taken as catalyst and Molybdenum (Mo) is taken as promotor. 

On reaction with oxygen (under extreme conditions), dinitrogen forms NO. Extreme conditions because $\ce{ N_{2} }$ does not undergo combustion under normal conditions.
$$\ce{ N_{2} + O_{2} ->[2000 K][\Delta, catalyst] 2NO }$$
It is an endothermic process. 

On reaction with Calcium carbide $\ce{ CaC_{2} }$, $\ce{ N_{2} }$ forms calcium Cyanamide. 
$$\ce{ CaC_{2} + N_{2} ->[\Delta] CaCN_{2} + C }$$
This $\ce{ CaCN_{2} + C }$ is called *Nitrolim fertiliser* because on reaction with water, it converts to ammonia which is then turned to nitrated by soil bacteria.

### Phosphorous 
 It is found in the form of ores in the earth crust. 

- Phosphorite: $\ce{ Ca_{3}(PO_{4})2 }$ 
- Chlorapatite: $\ce{ 3Ca_{3}(PO_{4})2.CaCl_{2} }$ 
- Fluorapatite: $\ce{ 3Ca_{3}(PO_{4})2.CaF_{2} }$ 

#### Preparation of Allotropes 
There are 3 common allotropes of P, Black, Red and White.

White phosphorous ($\ce{ P_{4} }$) is the most reactive due to high angle strain.

Black and Red phosphorous are very less reactive. 

![[Pasted image 20240301154250.png]]

Increasing density, mp and bp,
$$\ce{ P_{w} < P_{r} < P_{b} }$$
Decreasing reactivity,
$$\ce{ P_{w} > P_{r} > P_{b} }$$

White phosphorous is completely interconnected molecule, red phosphorous is polymeric covalently bonded chain like structure and black phosphorous is polymeric covalently bonded structure.

![[Pasted image 20240301155114.png]]

#### Properties 
##### White Phosphorous 
White waxy solid, garlic smell, insoluble in water but soluble in $\ce{ CS_{2}_{(l)} }$. Highly reactive due to angle strain. 

It is highly poisonous and glows in the dark because it emits radiations. 

$$\ce{ P_{4} + O_{2} ->[35^{\circ}C] P_{4}O_{10} + h\nu }$$
(slow combustion of $\ce{ P_{4} }$)

When a reaction produces light, it is called *chemiluminescence.*

Since here it is phosphorous, it is called *phosphorescence.*

[[00 GIC#Disproportionation Reaction]]

![[Pasted image 20240301160439.png]]

With metals, it forms phosphides. Which on hydrolysis produce phosphine gas. 

On reaction with iodine and water, $\ce{ P_{4} }$ forms $\ce{ PH_{4}I }$. This on reaction with aq. $\ce{ KOH }$ forms very pure phosphine.

![[Pasted image 20240301160743.png]]

##### Red Phosphorous
Odourless, non-poisonous and insoluble in water and $\ce{ CS_{2} }$.

Much less reactive than white P and does not glow in the dark.

It is used for making match boxes with $\ce{ P_{4}S_{3} }$.

![[Pasted image 20240301160915.png]]

##### Black Phosphorous 
Least reactive allotrope of P. 

Conductor of electricity (semi conductor). 

Insoluble in water and other organic solvents like $\ce{ CS_{2}, CHCl_{3} etc. }$. 

It is thermodynamically the most stable.  
$$\ce{ P_{w} < P_{r} < P_{b} }$$

$$
\begin{split}
\Delta H^{o}_{f} (P_{w}) &= 0 \\
\Delta H^{o}_{f} (P_{r}) &= -ve \\
\Delta H^{o}_{f} (P_{b}) &= -ve \text{ (most -ve)}
\end{split}
$$
