## Boron and Carbon Family 
B family is,
$$\ce{ B, Al, Ga, In, Tl }$$

C family is,
$$\ce{ C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb }$$

Heavy members show inert pair effect and thus the stability of lower OS (+1 for B family and +2 for C family) increases as we go down a group. 

Tl shows more stable compounds in +1 OS. Pb shows more stable compounds in +2 OS.

Tl can form $\ce{ TlCl_{3} }$ where $\ce{ Tl^{3+} }$ and $\ce{ 3Cl- }$ are the ions. But in $\ce{ TlI_{3} }$, the ions are $\ce{ Tl+, I_{3}- }$

## Boron Family 
B is a balck non metal which is very hard and has very high mp and bp. 

The rest elements are metals, i.e. $\ce{ Al, Ga, In, Tl }$. 

Al is metallic but many of its properties are similar to B. It is the most abundant *metal* and the third most abundant element after O and Si in the earth's crust. 

Ga has unusually low mp (303 K) but very high bp (2673 K)., due to this it is used to measure high temp. in pyrometers (used to measure very high temp.). 

EN first decreases from B to Al, and then increases slightly. This is the only notable exception in EN trends. 

Atomic radii increases from top to bottom.

##### Ores of B and Al

B is naturally found as
- [[09 Various Hybridisations#Borax|Borax:]] $\ce{ Na_{2}B_{4}O_{7}.10H_{2}O }$
- Colemanite: $\ce{ Ca_{2}B_{6}O_{11}.5H_{2}O }$
- Boric Acid: $\ce{ H_{3}BO_{3} }$

Al is found as,
- Bauxite: $\ce{ Al_{2}O_{3}.2H_{2}O }$
- Cryolite: $\ce{ Na_{3}AlF_{6} }$

#### Allotropes
B shows allotropy. 

It has 5 crystalline forms which are very less reactive and 2 amorphous forms which are more reactive. 

Tl has 3 allotropes.

Al, Ga, In do not show allotropy.

### Chemical Properties 

#### Reactivity towards Air
Amorphous B and other elements reacts with air on heating. 

$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
2E + 3O_{2} ->[\Delta] 2E_{2}O_{3} \\
2E + N_{2} ->[\Delta] 2EN
 }
\end{split}
$$

Oxides of the elements,
$$\ce{ \underset{ acidic }{ B_{2}O_{3} }, \underset{ amphoteric }{ Al_{2}O_{3}, Ba_{2}O_{3} }, \underset{ basic }{ In_{2}O_{3}, Tl_{2}O_{3} } }$$

#### Reactivity towards Acids 
B reacts with oxidising acids only. 

$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
B + HCl &-> No Reaction \\
B + conc. \& hot HNO_{3}/H_{2}SO_{4} &-> H_{3}BO_{3} + NO_{2}/SO_{2}
 }
\end{split}
$$

Al is more active than H and thus it liberates $\ce{ H_{2} }$ on reaction with acid. 

$$\ce{ Al + HCl -> AlCl_{3} + H_{2} }$$

Al is rendered passive by conc. $\ce{ HNO_{3} }$ due to formation of passive oxide film (protective) on the surface of Al.

## Carbon Family 
Density increases from top to bottom. 
$$\ce{ C_{gra} < Si < Ge < Sn < Pb }$$
$$\ce{ Si < C_{dia} < Ge < Sn < Pb }$$

And density of C allotropes, $\ce{ C_{dia} > C_{gra} }$

C is non metal while Si, Ge are metalloids and Sn and Pb are metals. 

IE decreases from top to bottom except Pd due to lanthanoid contraction.

Catenation,
$$\ce{ C \gg Si > Ge \approx Sn }$$

#### Sources 
C is found in,
- Oil (hydrocarbon) 
- Coal 
- Graphite
- Diamond 
- $\ce{ CaCO_{3} }$ (calcite), $\ce{ MgCO_{3} }$ (magnetite) 
- Natural gas

Si is found in,
- Silica, $\ce{ SiO_{2} }$ (sand or quartz) 
- Silicates 

Si is the 2nd most abundant element in earth crust after O.

Ge is found in coal.
Cassiterite ($\ce{ SnO_{2} }$) is the chief ore of Sn (tin).
Galena ($\ce{ PbS }$) is the chief ore of Pb. 

##### Allotropes of C
C has allotropes [[09.1 sp2#Allotropes or Carbon|graphite, diamond and fullerenes.]]  

**Fullerenes:**
- Pure form of C (no dangling bonds) 
- **Dangling Bond** means immobilised atom with unstable valence or immobilised free radicle. 
- 4th e is delocalised in molecular orbital thus giving aromatic character. 
- Fullerene is the least thermodynamically stable among graphite, diamond and fullerene.

##### Amorphous Carbon 
They are impure forms of graphite and fullerenes.
- Carbon Black
- Coke
- Charcoal

Incomplete burning of oils forms carbon black. It is used in making ink. 

Incomplete burning of wood forms charcoal. 

Calcination of coal forms coke which is used in metallurgy of Fe/Zn/Sn etc.

##### Allotropes of Si 
There are two types of tin which interconvert at around 13.2 $\ce{ ^{\circ}C }$. 

$$\ce{ \alpha-tin <=>[13.2 ^{\circ}C] \beta-tin }$$

$\alpha$ tin is a grey powdered diamond like structure. 
$\beta$ tin is metallic white tin.
