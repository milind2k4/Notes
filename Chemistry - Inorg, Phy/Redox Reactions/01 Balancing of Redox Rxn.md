# Balancing of Redox Reaction
The species not undergoing oxidation or reduction is called spectator. 

Find the net change in ON per atom of the oxidation and reduction pairs. 

Balancing of H and O are done in the end.

### Ion Electron Method
1. Assign ON of various elements and write oxidation half and reduction half in terms of ions and electrons only. Only pick the elements and not the whole compound.
   i.e. pick $\ce{ Mn^{7+} not KMnO_{4}, C_{2}^{3+} not H_{2}C_{2}O_{4} }$.

1. Add oxidation half and reduction half such that on addition the electrons cancel out. 

1. Write this reaction (called *Redox Skeleton*) in terms of species from where the ions are derived. 

1. Balance the elements other than O and H. 

1. Balance O and H,
	1. In **Acidic/Neutral medium:**
	   - $\ce{ H+ \& H_{2}O }$ are used
	   - First balance O by adding $\ce{ H_{2}O }$, then H by adding $\ce{ H+ }$
	
	2. In **Basic medium:**
	   - $\ce{ OH- \& H_{2}O }$ are used
	   - First balance O by adding $\ce{ H_{2}O }$, then H by adding $\ce{ H+ }$.
	   - If final reaction shows $\ce{ H+ }$ then kill it by adding equal number of $\ce{ OH- }$ to both sides.

### Oxidation Number Method
1. Write ON and identify oxidation and reduction pair. 

2. Find change in ON per element and cross multiply it. This gives the balanced redox part. 

3. The rest is the same as Ion Electron Method.

##### Balancing of Disproportionation Reaction
Write the reactant two times. Then follows the usual steps.
