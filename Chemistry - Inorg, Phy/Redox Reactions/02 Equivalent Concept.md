# Equivalent Concept
We can solve stoichiometric problems without balancing. 

Some Definitions:
1. **Equivalent Weight of a Substance:** molecular weight per valency factor. Unit is gram per equivalent.
   $$E = \frac{ M }{ v.f }$$

4. **Valency factor** is the number of e lost of gained per mol of substance. Or total change in ON per molecule/ion
   
   Valency factor is the amount of electricity suppled in faraday to produced 1 mole of substance. 
   $\\$

1. **Number of Gram Equivalent:** mass of substance per unit equivalent mass of substance
	$$\text{no of g.eq.} = \frac{ \text{mass of substance}  }{ \text{eq. mass of substance } } \times v.f$$
	$$\text{no of g.eq.} = \text{no of moles}\times v.f$$

3. **Normality:** number of gram equivalents per unit volume
	$$\text{normality} = \frac{ \text{no of g. eq.} }{ \text{moles of sol in L} } = \frac{ \text{no of moles} \times v.f. }{ V }$$
	$$\text{normality} = \text{molarity} \times v.f$$

### Calculation of Valency Factor
##### Acid base reaction
- *For an Acid*: v.f. of acid = actual number of $\ce{ H+ }$ ions lost or $\ce{ OH- }$ ions gained per molecule of acid.
	$\ce{ HCl ->[NaOH] NaCl }$, v.f. = 1
	$\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} ->[NaOH] NaHSO_{4} }$, v.f. = 1
	$\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} ->[NaOH][exce] Na_{2}SO_{4} }$, v.f. = 1

- *For a Base*: v.f. of acid = actual number of $\ce{ OH- }$ ions lost or $\ce{ H+ }$ ions gained per molecule of base.
	$\ce{ Sn(OH)2 ->[HCl] Sn(OH)Cl }$, v.f. = 1
	$\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} ->[HCl][excess] SnCl_{2} }$, v.f. = 2

- *For an Ionic Compound:* The total charge on the cation or the anion. 
 $\ce{ CaCl_{2} }$, v.f. = 2

##### Redox Reaction
It is the number of e lost or gained per molecule or species. 
Or change in ON per molecule.

$$\ce{ \overset{ -2 }{ N_{2} }H_{2} ->[I_{2}] \overset{ 0 }{ N_{2} } }$$
per N change = 2, there are 2 N. Thus, v.f. = 4

$$\ce{ K_{2}\overset{ +6 }{ Cr }_{2}O_{7} ->[R.A.] \overset{ +3 }{ Cr }^{3+} }$$
per Cr change = 3, there are 2 Cr, thus v.f. = 6

$$\ce{ K\overset{ +7 }{ Mn }O_{4} ->[acidic] \overset{ +2 }{ Mn }^{2+} }$$
v.f. = 5

$$\ce{ K\overset{ +7 }{ Mn }O_{4} ->[basic][or neutral] \overset{ +4 }{ Mn }O_{2} }$$
v.f. = 3

$$\ce{ K\overset{ +7 }{ Mn }O_{4} ->[strongly][basic] \overset{ +6 }{ Mn }O_{4}^{2-} }$$
v.f. = 1

For a substance in which there are 2 elements,
$$\ce{ \overset{ +2 }{ Fe }\overset{ +3 }{ C }_{2}O_{4} + \overset{ +7 }{ Mn }O_{4}- -> \overset{ +3 }{ Fe }^{3+} + \overset{ +4 }{ C }O_{2} + \overset{ +2 }{ Mn }^{2+} }$$
v.f. of $\ce{ FeC_{2}O_{4} }$ = 1 (for Fe) + 2 (for C) = 3

## Law of Chemical Equivalence
> The number of gram equivalents of every substance reacted or formed in a given chemical reaction are all equal.

$$\ce{ A + B -> C + D }$$
According to law of chemical equivalence, 
no of g. eq. of A reacted = no of g. eq. of B reacted = no. of g. eq. of C formed = no. of g. eq. of D formed

We can apply this law to any 2 substances in a reaction.

Now, 
$$N = \frac{ \text{no of g. eq} }{ V }$$
Thus,
$$N_{1}V_{1} = N_{2}V_{2}$$
N is normality. 

$$M_{1} \times (v.f)_{1} \times V_{1} = M_{2} \times (v.f)_{2} \times V_{2}$$
$$n_{1} \times (v.f)_{1} = n_{2} \times (v.f)_{2}$$

## Acid Base Titration
[[09 Acid Base Titrations]]

We take base as indicator.

Here, the reaction will be,
$$\ce{ HCl + NaOH -> NaCl + H_{2}O }$$

At equivalence point,
No. of g.eq. of acid = No. of g.eq of base 

Thus,
$$\ce{ N_{1}V_{1} = N_{2}V_{2} }$$

**Double Titration:** Involves use of two indicators to mark two equivalence points. Commonly used indicators are methyl orange and HPh. 

The purpose of DT is to find composition of mixture like $\ce{ NaHCO_{3} \& Na_{2}CO_{3} or NaOH \& Na_{2}CO_{3} }$ etc.

$\ce{ NaHCO_{3} }$ does react with HCl, but we're only looking at the time until the indicator changes colour. I.e. the colour changes before reaction with $\ce{ NaHCO_{3} }$.
