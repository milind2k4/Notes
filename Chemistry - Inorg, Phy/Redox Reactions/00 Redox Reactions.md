# Redox Reactions
**Redox Reaction:** Reaction which involves Oxidation (losing e or increase in ON) and Reduction (gaining e or decrease in ON).

*OILRIG:* Oxidation Is Loss Reduction is Gain

E.g. 
$$\ce{ \underbrace{ K_{2}\overset{ +6 }{ Cr_{2} }O_{7} }_{ \text{oxidant} } + \underbrace{ H_{2}\overset{ -1 }{ O_{2} } }_{ \text{reductant} } ->[H+] \overset{ +3 }{ Cr^{3+} } + \overset{ 0 }{ O_{2} } }$$

Oxidant aka oxidising agent.
Reductant aka reducing agent. 

The one which is oxidised acts as reducing agent and the one reduced acts as oxidising agent. 

Species in their intermediate OS can act as OA as well as RA.

#### Common Oxidising Agents
$$\ce{ KMnO_{4}, K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7}, O_{2}, O_{3}, F_{2}, Cl_{2}, Br_{2}, PbO_{2}, MnO_{2}, \text{conc.} HNO_{3}, \text{conc.} H_{2}SO_{4} }$$

They are generally in high oxidation state.
If they are in their highest OS they act as a oxidising agent only. 

Species having peroxy linkage act as good oxidising agent. 

#### Common Reducing Agents
$$\ce{ HI, HBr, H_{2}S, PH_{3}, H_{2}, CO, C, Metals, Metal hydrides, H_{2}C_{2}O_{4}, N_{2}H_{4} }$$
Metals for example, $\ce{ Na, Zn, Al etc }$.
Metal hydrides for example, $\ce{ NaH, CaH_{2}, LiAlH_{4}, NaBH_{4}, B_{2}H_{6} etc }$.

They are generally in low oxidation state. 
If they are in their lowest OS they act as a reducing agent only. 

### Oxidation Number
**Oxidation Number:** (aka Oxidation State) ON or OS of an atom in a molecule or species is the real or hypothetical charge it would have if all the bonds associated with it are considered ionic. 

ON of an atom in a given species may be 0 or integer. 
e.g. in $\ce{ CN- }$, ON of C is +2 and of N is -3.

Average ON of an element having 2 or more atoms in given species may be fractional, 0 or integer. 


##### Guidelines to find ON
- Average ON of an element in a homonuclear molecule is zero. 
- Sum of ON of all the atoms in given species is equal to the total actual charge on it. 
- ON oh H is +1 except in ionic hydrides where it is -1. e.g. $\ce{ NaH, CaH_{2}, AlH_{3} }$ etc. 
- ON of alkaline metals in compound is +1, of alkaline earth metals is +2. Some elements have fixed ON, **Zn, Cd = +2** and **Sc, Al = +3**.
- ON of F is -1 always, as it is the most EN element in the PT. 
- ON of O is usually -2 except in following:
	- Peroxides ($\ce{ H_{2}O_{2}, Na_{2}O_{2}, BaO_{2} }$) = -1 
	- Superoxides ($\ce{ KO_{2}, RbO_{2} }$) = -1/2 
	- Ozonides ($\ce{ KO_{3} }$) = -1/3 
	-   $\ce{ OF_{2} }$ = +2 
	-   $\ce{ O_{2}F_{2} }$ = +1

To check if the ON is wrong or not,
- ON cannot be more than +8
- Range of ON in **p-block** elements:
  max. ON = group no. - 10 
  min. ON = group no. - 18
- Range of ON in **d-block** elements:
  max. ON = group no. *(up to group no. 8)*

If ON calculated from guidelines violates the above, then the calculated ON is wrong and instead it should be found using Lewis Dot Structure. 

*Shortcut:* if the ON comes out to be more than the max allowed, the real ON is the max allowed. 
e.g. in $\ce{ H_{2}S_{2}O_{8} }$ by calculation ON of S is +7 which is not possible, thus it is +6 which is the max. 

Some examples where we cannot find ON using guidelines,

## Types of Redox Reaction
1. **Intermolecular:** Involves different compounds acting as OA and RA.
   e.g. $\ce{ KMnO_{4} + H_{2}C_{2}O_{4} -> MnSO_{4} + CO_{2} }$
   $\ce{ KMnO_{4} }$ is reduced
   $\ce{ H_{2}C_{2}O_{4} }$ is oxidised. 

2. **Intramolecular:** Elements undergoing oxidation and reduction belong to the same compound. 
   e.g. $\ce{ K\overset{ +5 }{ Cl }\overset{ -2 }{ O }_{3} -> K\overset{ -1 }{ Cl } + \overset{ 0 }{ O }_{2} }$

3. **Disproportionation:** see below

### Disproportionation Reaction
Same element in same OS from same compound undergoes oxidation as well as reduction. 

E.g.
$$\ce{ \overset{ 0 }{ Br_{2} } + \underset{ conc }{ OH- } -> \overset{ -1 }{ Br- } + \overset{ +5 }{ Br }O_{3}- + H_{2}O }$$

$$\ce{ P_{4} + NaOH + H_{2}O ->[\Delta ] \overset{ -3 }{ P }H_{3} + NaH_{2}\overset{ +1 }{ P }O_{2} }$$

$$\ce{ H_{2}\overset{ -1 }{ O }_{2} ->[\Delta] H_{2}\overset{ -2 }{ O } + \overset{ 0 }{ O }_{2} }$$

$$\ce{ Cl_{2} ->[NaOH][\Delta ] \overset{ -1 }{ Cl }- + \overset{ +5 }{ Cl }O_{3}- }$$

$$\ce{ H_{3}\overset{ +3 }{ P }O_{3} ->[\Delta] H_{3}\overset{ +5 }{ P }O_{4} + \overset{ -3 }{ P }H_{3} ^ }$$

Reverse of disproportionation is called **Comproportionation**

$$\ce{ X- + XO_{3}- ->[acidic][H+] X_{2} + H_{2}O }$$
X = Cl/Br/I
