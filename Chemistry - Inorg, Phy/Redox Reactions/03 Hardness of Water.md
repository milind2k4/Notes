# Hardness of Water
#removed 

Hard water contains dissolved salts of $\ce{ Ca^{2+} \& Mg^{2+} }$ mainly which interferes in making micelles with soap.

##### Temporary Hardness 
Due to dissolved bicarbonates of calcium and magnesium. 
This hardness can be removed by just boiling hard water. 

##### Permanent Hardness 
Due to dissolved sulphates/chlorides of calcium and magnesium.  
This hardness can't be removed by boiling, special methods are used. 

#### Methods of Hardness Removal
1. **By boiling:** For temporary hardness. 
   $$\ce{ Ca(HCO_{3})2 ->[boiling] CaCO_{3} v + H_{2}O + CO_{2} ^ }$$
   $$\ce{ Mg(HCO_{3})2 ->[boiling] Mg(OH)2 v + 2CO_{2} ^ }$$

2. **By Adding Slaked Lime $(\ce{ Ca(OH)2 })$ or Quick Lime $\ce{(CaO)}$:** For temporary hardness
	$$\ce{ Ca(HCO_{3})2 + Ca(OH)2 -> 2CaCO_{3} v + 2H_{2}O }$$
	This is called Clark's Process.

1. **By using Washing Soda $(\ce{ Na_{2}CO_{3} })$:** For permanent hardness
	$$\ce{ CaCl_{2} + Na_{2}CO_{3} -> CaCO_{3} v 2NaCl }$$
	$\ce{NaCl}$ does not cause hardness. 
	$$\ce{ CaSO_{4} + Na_{2}CO_{3} -> MgCO_{3} v Na_{2}SO_{4} }$$
	$\ce{ Na_{2}SO_{4} }$ does not cause hardness. 

4. **By using Resins (Permutit method):** For permanent hardness
	Resins are usually aluminosilicates. $\ce{ (Na_{2}Al_{2}Si_{2}O_{8}) }$
	$$\ce{ Na_{2}R + CaCl_{2} -> CaR v 2NaCl }$$

5. **Calgon Method:** For permanent hardness
	Poly phosphates are used which form soluble complex with calcium and magnesium. 
	$$\ce{ (NaPO_{3})6 {}_{(aq)} + Ca^{2+}/Mg^{2+} -> Na_{2}[Ca_{2}(PO_{3})6] {}_{(aq)} + 2Na+ }$$

## Degree of Hardness
Measure of extent of hardness of water. 

Defined as mass of $\ce{ CaCO_{3} }$ equivalent to all the hardness causing substance in $10^{6}$ g of water. 

Equivalent of $\ce{ CaCO_{3} }$ = equivalent of all hardness causing substance, in million gram of water. 

The unit is ppm or parts per million.

1. Identify the hardness causing substances. 

E.g. Hardness of 100 ml water sample having $\ce{ W_{1} g of CaCl_{2}, W_{2} g of NaCl, W_{3} g of Mg(HCO_{3})2 }$ can be calculated as,

$$\ce{ eq. of CaCO_{3} = \frac{ W_{CaCO_{3}} }{ 100 } * 2 = \left( \frac{ W_{1} }{ 111 }*2 + \frac{ W_{2} }{ 146 } * 2 \right) \times \frac{ 10^{6} }{ 100 } }$$

The W of Calcium Carbonate calculated will be the degree of hardness.
