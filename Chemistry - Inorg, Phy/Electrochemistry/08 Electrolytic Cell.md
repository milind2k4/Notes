# Electrolytic Cell
Opposite to galvanic cell. Converts electrical energy into chemical energy. The reaction is not spontaneous. 

Cell where electrolysis occurs which is chemical decomposition of an electrolyte with the help of electricity supplied from an external source (battery).

Here, cathode is -ve as the cation of the electrolyte moves there and anode is +ve as anion moves there, but there is still oxidation at anode and reduction at cathode. 

In Galvanic cell, the cathode is +ve and anode is -ve.

#### Electrolysis of Molten NaCl
Cathode: 
$$\ce{ Na+ + e- -> Na }$$
Anode: 
$$\ce{ Cl- -> 1/2 Cl_{2} + e- }$$
Cell Reaction: 
$$\ce{ Na+ + Cl- -> Na_{(s)} + 1/2 Cl_{2}_{(g)} }$$

It is non spontaneous. 

Here, Na and Cl are called products of electrolysis.

## Preferential Deposition 
Or Preferential Electrolysis #important 
[[03 IUPAC Rep. of Cell and ECS#Electrochemical Series]]

Deals with the preference to be given to species which undergoes reduction at cathode or oxidation at anode during electrolysis. 

Particularly, when electrolysis of aqueous solution of electrolytes is done then it becomes important to identify the species that undergo reduction and oxidation. 

For species competing for reduction at cathode, higher the SRP, greater will be the ease of reduction. 

Increasing SRP values, so increasing order of ease of reduction at cathode,
$$\ce{ K+, Ca^{2+}, Na+, Mg^{2+}, Al^{3+}, H_{2}O, Zn^{2+}, Fe^{2+}, H+, Cu^{2+}, Ag+, Au^{3+} }$$
Thus we cannot reduce ions that come before water in aqueous solution. #important 

For species competing for oxidation at anode, higher the SOP (or lower the SRP), greater will be the ease of oxidation. 

Increasing SOP values, so increasing order of ease of reduction,
$$\ce{ SO_{4}^{2-}, NO_{3}-, H_{2}O, OH-, Cl-, Br-, I- }$$
$\ce{ Cl-, Br-, I- }$ are very easily oxidised. 

#### Formation of Anion of Marshal's Acid
Electrolysis of dilute $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$,
*Cathode:* $\ce{ 2H+ + 2e- -> H_{2} }$
*Anode:* $\ce{ 2H_{2}O -> O_{2} ^ + 4H+ + 4e- }$

However, electrolysis of concentrated $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$ or $\ce{ (NH_{4})2SO_{4} }$, #important 
*Cathode:* 
$$\ce{ 2H+ + 2e- -> H_{2} ^ }$$
$$or$$
$$\ce{ 2NH_{4}+ + 2e -> NH_{3} ^ + H_{2} ^ }$$
*Anode:* 
$$\ce{ SO_{4}^{2-} -> S_{2}O_{8}^{2-} + 2e- }$$
$\ce{ S_{2}O_{8} }$ is **peroxy disulphate acid,** which is anion of **Marshal's acid ($\ce{ H_{2}S_{2}O_{8} }$).** 

#### Overpotential 
SOP data indicates that oxidation of $\ce{ H_{2}O }$ will be preferred over $\ce{ Cl- }$. #important 

$$\ce{ 2Cl- -> Cl_{2} + 2e-, E^{o}_{SOP} = -1.36 }$$
From this thermodynamic data, it appears that $\ce{ O_{2} }$ will be liberated in preference to $\ce{ Cl_{2} }$ during electrolysis of NaCl solution. 

However, this does not happen and $\ce{ Cl_{2} }$ gas liberates in preference to $\ce{ O_{2} }$ because liberation of $\ce{ O_{2} }$ from oxidation of water is a kinetically slow process. 
And since reaction is decided by thermodynamics and chemical kinetics, $\ce{ Cl_{2} }$ is liberated. 

For effective liberation of $\ce{ O_{2} }$ gas from water an additional voltage needs to be applied which is called **Overvoltage or Overpotential.** 
In other words, OV or OP of $\ce{ O_{2} }$ from water is high whereas OV of $\ce{ Cl_{2} }$ from $\ce{ Cl- }$ is negative. 

Two important examples of OV are,
- $\ce{ Cl_{2} }$ liberates in preference to $\ce{ O_{2} }$ from electrolysis of brine solution (NaCl solution).
- In Castner Kellner cell for production of NaOH, mercury liquid cathode is used to reduce $\ce{ Na+ -> Na }$ at it by electrolysis of brine. 

	At Hg cathode, OV of liberation of $\ce{ H_{2} }$ from water is very high thus it does not liberate and rather $\ce{ Na+ }$ is reduced to Na forming sodium amalgam.

### Reduction and Oxidation of Water  
##### Reduction of Water
(at cathode)

$$\ce{ 2H_{2}O {}_{(l)} + 2e- -> H_{2} ^ + 2OH-, E^{o}_{SRP} = -0.83 V }$$
The solution becomes basic. 

Similarly, reduction of $\ce{ H+ }$,
$$\ce{ 2H+ + 2e- -> H_{2} ^ }$$

Valency factor of $\ce{ H_{2} }$ is 2 on both cases. 

##### Oxidation of Water
(at anode)

$$\ce{ 2H_{2}O -> O_{2} ^ + 4H+ + 4e-, E^{o}_{SOP} = -1.23 V }$$

Similarly, oxidation of $\ce{ OH- }$,
$$\ce{ 2OH- -> 1/2 O_{2} ^ + H_{2}O + 2e- }$$

valency factor of $\ce{ O_{2} }$ is 4 in both cases.
