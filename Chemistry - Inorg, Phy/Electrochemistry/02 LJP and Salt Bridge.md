# Liquid Junction Potential
It is the ***undesired Potential developed in the solution due to charge separation.***

At first as $\ce{ Zn }$ is dipped in $\ce{ ZnSO_4 }$ there is a tendency of oxidation but as the cell functions more $\ce{ Zn^{2+} }$ ions come to the solution, they form a layer around the metal rod which results in  the solution becoming negatively charged and becoming positively charged around the rod.

This creates a potential difference in the solution which is called the Liquid Junction Potential.

It is not suitable & not desirable for the for the proper functioning of the cell because if there is a layer of $\ce{ Zn^{2+} }$ around the rod it repels the incoming $\ce{ Zn }$ ions which stops the process. 

To Counter this a Salt Bridge is used.

Above, the mobility of $\ce{ H^{+} }$ ions is more than that of $\ce{ Cl^{-} }$ ions. And the potential difference across the wall is due to difference in mobility is liquid junction potential.

## Salt Bridge
An inverted u-shaped tube filled with concentrated solution of an inert electrolyte in gel form.
To make the electrolyte highly viscous (gel like), gelatin or agar agar or dride is added.

However, if 2 electrodes are dipped in the same electrolyte solution, we need not use a Salt Bridge.

#### Function of Salt bridge
1. It completes the inner circuit of the cell (where ions move instead of e, which move in the outer circuit)
   $\\$

1. Keeps Anode half and cathode half electrically neutral.
   $\\$
   
2. Ions of salt bridge electrolyte diffuse through gel like solution and minimize liquid junction potential. 
   $\\$
   
4. Salt bridge doesn't allow the bulk flow of components of anode to cathode and vice-versa. However a minor diffusion of components of anode or cathode can occur through salt bridge.
   $\\$
   
5. It is not needed for a galvanic cell in which a common electrolyte of anode half and cathode half is present.
	$$\ce{ Pt | \underset{ p_{1} }{ H_{2}(g) } | HCl(aq) | \underset{ p_{2} }{ H_{2}(g) } | Pt }$$
	This is an example of concentration cell.

#### Properties of Salt Bridge 
1. Electrolyte of salt bridge should be inert towards components of anode and cathode half. I.e. there should be no complexation or precipitation. 
   
   E.g. KCl cannot be used in a cell where $\ce{ Ag+, Hg^{2+}, Pb^{2+} }$ etc are present as $\ce{ Cl- }$ forms precipitate with them. 
   $\\$
   
1. Cation or anion of electrolyte of salt bridge should have equal or nearly equal ionic mobility.
