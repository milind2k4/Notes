# Electrochemistry
It deals with interconversion of chemical action into electrical energy and vice versa.

These interactions occur at boundaries b/w electrolyte and electrode dipping in it. All these interconversions occur in a device called electrochemical cell. 

A cell is an arrangement that converts electrical energy into chemical action or vice versa. It consists of an electrode (meal rod, or strip or wire) dipped into an electrolyte solution. 

Electrochemistry is divided into 3 parts,
- [[01 Working of Galvanic Cell]]
- [[08 Electrolytic Cell]]
- [[11 Electrolytic Conduction]]

### Electrochemical Cells
-  **Galvanic Cell**
	- A spontaneous chemical reaction ($\Delta G = -ve$) occurs and electrical energy is produced. 
	  *Eg*: Daniel Cell, dry cell, lead storage battery etc. 
	- Chemical energy is converted into electrical.
	  $\\$
	  
- **Electrolytic Cell**
	- Electrolytic Decomposition (aka, Electrolysis) i.e. a non spontaneous process, (i.e., $\Delta G = +ve$) is done by providing electrical E from external source such as another cell or battery.
	  $$or$$
	  A non spontaneous reaction is made to move forward by supplying electrical E from an external source.
	  *Applications:* Electroplating, Refining of metals etc.
	  
	- Electrical energy is converted into chemical energy.

In both the cases, redox reactions occur.

### Ionic Mobility
Represented by $u_{+}$ or $u_{-}$. 

It is the speed acquired by an ion under unit potential gradient.

$$u_{+} = \frac{ v_{+} }{ V /d } = \frac{ v_{+} }{ E }$$
where,
$v_{+} \to$ speed of cation
$V \to$ Voltage 
$d \to$ separation between electrodes 

In terms of molar conductivity,
$$
\begin{split}
u_{+} &= \frac{ \lambda_{+} }{ Z_{+} \times F } \\
u_{-} &= \frac{ \lambda_{-} }{ Z_{-} \times F } \\
\end{split}
$$
where 
$\lambda_{+}, \lambda_{-} \to$ ionic conductivities of of ion
$Z_{+}, Z_{-} \to$ unit charge on ionic 
$F \to$ Faraday's constant

#### Transport Number (t)
It is the fraction of total current carried by each ion of the electrolyte. 

$$
\begin{split}
t_{+} &= \frac{ u_{+} }{ u_{+} + u_{-} } \\
t_{-} &= \frac{ u_{-} }{ u_{+} + u_{-} } \\
\end{split}
$$

## Cells 
### Lead Storage Battery
aka **Lead Storage Accumulator.**

It is a secondary battery (i.e. it can be recharged).
It is used in automobiles and power backup in homes. 

Anode is lead, Pb
Cahode is Lead coated with lead oxide, $\ce{ PbO_{2} }$. 

Electrolyte is conc. $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$ which is 38% by mass. 

**Anode reaction:**
$$\ce{ Pb + SO_{4}_{(aq)}^{2-} -> PbSO_{4}_{(s)} + 2e- }$$
**Cathode reaction:**
$$\ce{ PbO_{2} + 4H+_{(aq)} + SO_{4}_{(aq)}^{2-} + 2e- -> PbSO_{4}_{(s)} + 2H_{2}O_{(l)} }$$

 **Cell Reaction:**
$$\ce{ Pb_{(s)} + PbO_{2}_{(s)} + 2H_{2}SO_{4}_{(aq)} <=>[discharging][charging] 2PbSO_{4}_{(aq)} + 2H_{2}O_{(l)} }$$

If we withdraw 2 F electricity, 2 moles of $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$ are consumed. And, if we supply 2 F electricity, 2 moles of $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$ will be generated.

### Fuel Cell 
It is used in rockets and is very costly. 

$\ce{ H_{2}/O_{2} }$ fuel cell is a green fuel cell as non pollutant $\ce{ H_{2}O }$ product is formed.

Hydrocarbon-oxygen fuel cells are also possible. Like $\ce{ C_{3}H_{8}/O_{2} }$.

**At Anode:**
$$\ce{ H_{2}_{(g)} + 2OH-_{(aq)} -> 2H_{2}O_{(l)} + 2e- }$$
**At Cathode:**
$$\ce{ 1/2 O_{2}_{(g)} + H_{2}O_{(l)} -> 2OH-_{(aq)} }$$

**Cell Reaction:**
$$\ce{ H_{2}_{(g)} + 1/2 O_{2}_{(g)} -> H_{2}O_{(l)} }$$

And in essence it is a combustion reaction.
