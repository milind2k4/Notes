# Faraday's Laws
### Faraday's First Law
*Mass of product of electrolysis at an electrode during electrolysis is directly proportional to the quantity of electricity supplied.* 

$$
\begin{split}
W &\propto q \\
&\propto It \\
W &= zit
\end{split}
$$
where z is called **Electrochemical Equivalent (ECE)** of substance and W is the mass of product of electrolysis deposited or liberated. 

$$z = \frac{ W }{ it }$$
If 1 ampere of electricity is supplied for 1 second (1 coulomb), then the mass deposited or liberated is equal to ECE. 

1 Faraday is the amount of electricity that produces mass of substance equal to its equivalent weight (E).

We can find z in terms of E and F,
$$z = \frac{ E }{ F } = \frac{ E }{ 96500 }$$
where E is equivalent weight.

Thus,
$$W = \frac{ Eit }{ 96500 }$$

If current is not 100% efficient,
$$W = \frac{ Eit }{ 96500 } \times \eta$$
where $\eta$ is current efficiency ($\leq 1$).
If nothing is mentioned, take $\eta = 1$. 

*No. of faraday supplied from battery = no of gram equivalents of substance produced at an electrode = number of moles times valency factor*
$$\text{no. of F = no. of g.eq. = no. of moles} \times \text{valency factor}$$
v.f. is the no. of e lost or gained per molecule or formula unit.
And vf of O in electrolysis of water is 4 and that of H is 2.

No. of moles of e,
$$\text{no. of moles of e = no. of F} = \frac{ it }{ 96500 }$$ 
Thus,
$$\ce{ \frac{ it }{ 96500 } = no. of moles\times v.f. }$$

Also, from battery, equal amount of electricity (or equal charge) passes at cathode and anode provided current efficiencies of cathode and anode are equal. #important 

Thus, no. of g. eq of products at cathode = no. of g. eq. of products at anode

### Faraday's Second Law
If cells are connected in series and charge passed is the same then the ratio of weights of element deposited is equal to the ratio of their equivalent weights.

$$
\begin{split}
W_{1} &= z_{1}q \\
W_{2} &= z_{2} q \\
\\
\frac{ W_{1} }{ W_{1} } &= \frac{ z_{1} }{ z_{2} } \\
\\
\frac{ W_{1} }{ W_{2} } &= \frac{ E_{1} }{ E_{2} }
\end{split}
$$

Electrolytic Cells are sometimes called **Coulometer.**
