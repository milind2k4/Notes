####  Electrorefining of blister copper
#important 

Electrolysis of $\ce{ CuSO_{4} }$ using Cu electrodes. 

*Cathode:* $\ce{ Cu^{2+} + 2e- -> Cu }$
Reduction of copper.

*Anode:* $\ce{ Cu -> Cu^{2+} + 2e- }$
The copper anode will be oxidised (called *attackable electrolysis*).

Effectively concentration of copper ion remains constant.

The anode is made of impure copper we want to purify. Blister copper is 98% pure and is not usable in electrical wires. 

At Cathode: $\ce{ Cu^{2+} + 2e- -> Cu }$
This pure copper deposits on copper cathode plate. 

At anode, oxidation of $\ce{ SO_{4}^{2-} }$ does not happen as its $\ce{ E^{o}_{SOP} }$ is highly -ve. 
The anode itself gets oxidised as its $\ce{ E^{o}_{SOP} = -0.34 V }$ is higher than $\ce{ E^{o}_{SOP} = -1.23 V }$ of water. Thus oxidation of water also does not happen. 

Thus to purify a metal using electrorefining methods, we make the anode out of the impure metal. 

The impurities get deposited as **Anode mud** which contains mainly Ag, Au, Pt, Se, Te, Sb metals which are very less reactive and thus are not oxidised. Thus anode mud is by-product.

Metals above Au (Au excluding) and below Ag (Ag excluding) can be electro-refined in aq. solution. 

Commonly refined metals are: Cu, Zn, Ni, Sn etc.

In case when electricity is left at either cathode or anode, the remaining electricity will reduce or oxidise the water.
