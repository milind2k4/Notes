# Deviation from Ideal Gas
Deviation of real gas from ideal behaviour depends on P and T conditions and can be depicted as,

Here volume is molar volume which is $\displaystyle V_{n} = \frac{ V }{ n }$

Here T is constant.

Here we can see that real gases deviate much from ideal behaviour when P is high. Real gases have more volume at low V than ideal. 

When P is low, the volumes are close, but volume of Real gas is less than that of ideal gas. 

**Compressibility Factor (Z):** (aka Compression Factor) is a measure of extent of deviation of real gas from ideal gas. It is defined as the ratio of molar volume of real gas and ideal gas under same P and T conditions. 

$$Z = \frac{ V_{mr} }{ V_{mi} }$$
$$Z = \frac{ V_{mr} }{ RT / P }$$
$$Z = \frac{ PV_{r} }{ nRT }$$

Thus, 
$$PV_{r} = ZnRT$$
Z of a gas depends on P and T and is thus not constant. And is a +ve non zero number.
If Z = 1 for all P and T then the gas is ideal. If not then gas is real. 

It is possible that the value of Z be 1 for a real gas at a particular P and T.
If Z > 1 then gas is said to show +ve deviation. 
If Z < 1 then gas is said to show -ve deviation. 

Deviations of real gas from ideal behaviour can be better explained by compressibility factror (Z) vs P graph.

#### Z vs P graph
It is experimental graph. T is constant.

For same gas at different T. As we increase T, both +ve and -ve deviations decrease. Thus at really really high T, the gas will be almost the ideal gas.
