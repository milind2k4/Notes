# Boyle's Temperature $(T_{b})$
It is the T at which a real gas behaves similar to an ideal gas in a range of pressure from zero pressure.

That is, $PV_{m}$ is constant for a real gas in a range of pressure from zero pressure at $T_{b}$. Z becomes 1 for a range of P from zero P at $T_{b}$.

At Boyle's T gas behaves ideally, i.e. when $P \to 0$ and $T = T_{b}$,
$$\frac{ d(PV_{m}) }{ dV_{m} } = 0$$

$$
\begin{split}
\left( P + \frac{a}{V_{m}^{2}} \right)(V_{m}-b) &= RT
\\
PV_{m} &= \left( \frac{ RT }{ V_{m}-b } - \frac{a}{V_{m}^{2}} \right) \times V_{m} 
\\
PV_{m} &= \frac{ RTV_{m} }{ V_{m} - b } - \frac{ a }{ V_{m} } \\ 
\\
\text{Differentiating this w.r.t V at const. T,} & 
\\
\left. \frac{ dPV_{m} }{ dV }  \right|_{T}  &= \frac{ -bRT }{ (V_{m} - b)^{2} } + \frac{a}{V_{m}^{2}} \\
\\
\text{At, } T = T_{b}, & \\
\frac{ a }{ V_{m}^{2} } &= \frac{bRT_{b}}{(V_{m}-b)^{2}} \\
T_{b} &= \frac{ a }{ Rb }\left( 1 - \frac{ b }{ V_{m} } \right) \\
\\
\text{At } P \to 0, V_{m} \to \infty, \text{thus, } & \\
T_{b} &= \frac{ a }{ Rb }
\end{split}
$$

Thus we get, Boyle's T,
$$T_{b} = \frac{ a }{ Rb }$$

**Note:**
1. If T of a real gas is less  tan it's $T_{b}$ then it shows -ve deviation in low P range.

1. Real gas shows +ve deviation at high P and $T_{b}$. 

1. At $T_{b}$, real gas behaves ideally in low P range because attractive influence of $a$ is nearly compensated by $b$.
