# Classification of Salts
We can classify salts on the basis of acidic and basic nature,
- **Acidic** which contain one or more acidic H, e.g. $\ce{ NaH_{2}PO_{4}, Na_{2}HPO_{4} }$ etc.
- **Neutral** e.g. $\ce{ NaCl, Ba(SO_{4}), BaCl_{2}, Na_{2}SO_{4} }$ etc.
- **Basic** which contain one or more OH, e.g. $\ce{ Zn(OH)Clm Sn(OH)Cl }$ etc.

We can also classify on the basis of number of ions.

### Simple Salt
Containing only one type of cation and one anion.
e.g. $\ce{ NaCl,\ BaSO_{4},\ CaCl_{2},\ Na_{2}CO_{3}\ etc. }$

### Mixed Salt
Containing more than one type of anion or cation.
e.g. 
   - Bleaching Powder, $\ce{ CaOCl_{2} }$ having one cation $\ce{ Ca^{2+} }$ and two anions $\ce{ Cl^{-}\ \&\ OCl^{-} }$. The bleaching action is due to the oxidizing nature of $\ce{ OCl^{-} }$ (hypochlorite ion)
     $\\$
    
   - Microcosmic Salt, $\ce{ Na(NH_{4})HPO_{4} . 4H_{2}O }$  (used in qualitative analysis in phosphate bead test)
     It has 2 cations $\ce{ Na^{+} \&\ NH_{4}^{+} }$ and one anion $\ce{ HPO_{4}^{2-} }$.

### Double Salt 
A combination of two simple salts in a definite molar ratio. 

It is obtained when two simple salt solutions in required molar ratio are mixed and evaporated to dryness.

For Example,
   - **Potash alum:** $\ce{ K_{2}SO_{4} . Al_{2}(SO_{4})_{3} . 24H_{2}O }$
      (other types of alum as well)
     Here the salts $\ce{ K_{2}SO_{4} }$ & $\ce{ Al_{2}(SO_{4})3 }$ are mixed in a $1:1$ ratio.
     It can be obtained when aq. solutions of both salts are mixed in $1:1$ ratio and evaporated to dryness. The residue obtained is the Alum. 
     $\\$
    
   - **Mohr Salt:** $\ce{ FeSO_{4} . (NH_{4})_{2}SO_{4} . 6H_{2}O }$
     Here the salts $\ce{ FeSO_{4} }$ & $\ce{ (NH_{4})_{2}SO_{4} }$ are mixed in a $1:1$ ratio.
     $\\$
    
   - **Carnallite ore:** $\ce{ KCl. MgCl_{2} . 6 H_{2}O }$
	Here the salts $\ce{ KCl }$ & $\ce{ MgCl_{2} }$ are mixed in a $1:1$ ratio.


Aq. solution of double salt gives qualitative tests of all ions of salt.
E.g. Aq. solution of Potash Alum gives qualitative tests of $\ce{ K^{+}, SO_{4}^{2-} \& Al^{3+} }$

This means that ions are freely available in the solutions of double salts. 
Such property is not shown by Complex Salts or Coordination Compounds and is thus the distinction between Double and Complex salts. 

### Complex Salts (Coordination Compounds)
Consists of a Central atom/ion (generally a *metal atom of small size* or a *non metal atom with low EN*) attached with definite number of species (called ligands) through **coordinate bonds** in a definite geometry.

The product of 
$$\ce{ CuSO_{4} + NH_{3} -> [Cu(NH_{3})_{4}]SO_{4} }$$

Is a complex salt which has $\ce{ Cu }$ as the central atom and the 4 $\ce{ NH_{3} }$ are called ligands.

Here $\ce{ Cu^{2+} }$ is not freely available in the solution and thus it cannot give test for $\ce{ Cu^{2+} }$. It can however give tests of $\ce{ SO_{4}^{2+} }$ and $\ce{ [Cu(NH_{3})_{4}]^{2+} }$
