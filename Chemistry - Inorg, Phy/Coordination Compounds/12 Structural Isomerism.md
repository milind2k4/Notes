# Structural Isomerism
Same formula but different connectivity

#### Ionisation 
Isomers which give different ions in aq solution. 

This arises due to exchange between ligands and counter ions. 

E.g. 
$$\ce{ [Pt(en)_{2}Br_{2}]Cl_{2} \ \ [Pt(en)_{2}Cl_{2}]Br_{2} \ \ [Pt(en)_{2}BrCl]BrCl}$$

#### Hydrate
When water acts as ligands and can also act as water of crystallisation. 

It arises when ligand $\ce{ H_{2}O }$ can be exchanged with counter ions. 

All Hydrate isomers are Ionisation isomers also.

E.g.
$$\ce{ [Co(H_{2}O)_{6}]Cl_{3} \ \ [Co(H_{2}O)_{5}Cl]Cl_{2}.H_{2}O \ \ [Co(H_{2}O)4Cl_{2}]Cl . 2H_{2}O }$$

#### Linkage
Arises when there are [[00 Coordination Compounds#Ambidentate Ligands|Ambidentate ligands.]] 

E.g.
$$\ce{ [Co(NH_{3})_{5}CN]Cl_{2} \ \ [Co(NH_{3})_{5}NC]Cl_{2} }$$

#### Coordination 
When there are 2 coordination spheres in one complex.

Arises when both cationic and anionic parts are complex. 

These isomers are due to exchange of ligands or CA in cationic or anionic complex parts. 

E.g.
$$\ce{ [Co(H_{2}O)_{6}][Cr(CN)_{6}] \ \ [Co(H_{2}O)_{5}CN][Cr(CN)_{5}H_{2}O] \ \ [Cr(H_{2}O)_{6}][Co(CN)_{6}]}$$

Take care to see that both the anion and cation has some charge. Otherwise the complex will not exist. 
$$\ce{ [Cr(NH_{3})3(CN)3][Co(NH_{3})3(CN)3] }$$
does not exist as both the CSs' are neutral. 

#### Ligand
When ligand is organic and itself shows isomerism. 

E.g.

the first one is pn and the second one is tn.
