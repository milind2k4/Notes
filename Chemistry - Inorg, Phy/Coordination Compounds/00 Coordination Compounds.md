# Coordination Compounds
### Definitions
#### Coordination Sphere or Entity
The part of complex compound which consists of central atom and various ligands. (everything inside the [])

#### Ionisation Sphere or Counter Ion or Free Ion
The part other than Coordination sphere 
They are connect to the central metal by ionic bonds.

#### Central atom
Generally a *small sized* metal atom (generally from the d or p-block) or ion. They could also be electropositive non metals like B, Br, I etc.

It acts as a Lewis Acid and usually accepts lone pair from the ligands in vacant orbital and forms coordinate bond.

Small sized metal atoms like Be, Mg, Li etc can behave as CA. This is because small sized CA forms short and strong coordinate bonds. 

d and p block metal like Co, Ag, Au, Pd, Fe, Cr, Mn, Mo etc act as CA. 

#### Ligands
Molecule or ion, having lp electrons which can be donated to the central metal atom to form coordinate bonds. However some ligands donate $\pi$ e density to CA.

Ligands which donate lp behave as Lewis Base.

Examples of ligands which donate lp e are $\ce{ X-, OH-, H_{2}O, NH_{3}, NH_{2}-, PH_{3}, Py, CN-, CO }$ etc. 

Some ligands which donate $\pi$ e density are $\ce{ CH_{2}=CH_{2}, C_{6}H_{6} }$


#### Denticity of Central Metal 
The number of sigma coordinate bond formed by a ligand with the same central atom. 

It is a property of ligand.

[[02 Types of Ligands]]

#### Chelation
When a bidentate or polydentate ligands forms a coordinate bond with CA then a ring is formed called *chelating ring* and the phenomenon is called chelation. 

These ligands are called **Chelating Ligand.**
Monodentate ligands cannot show chelation.

(here we can see that en is bidentate)

Chelating ligands provide extra stability. 
This is called **Chelate Effect** or **Entropic Effect.**

#### Coordination Number of CM
Total number of $\sigma$ coordinate bonds formed by CM with the various ligands.

Most common CN are 6, 4, 2, 3, 5 etc. in that order of rarity. 
One bidentate ligand makes 2 $\sigma$ coordinate bonds.

#### Ambidentate Ligands
Ligands which can legate through different donor atoms. 
Or simply, Ligands having more than one donor site.

$\ce{ -CN^{-} } \to$ Cyanide
$\ce{ -NC^{-} } \to$ Isocyanide

$\ce{ -NO_{2}^{-} } \to$ Nitro
$\ce{ -ONO^{-} } \to$ Nitrite 

$\ce{ -OCN^{-} } \to$ Cyanate
$\ce{ -NCO^{-} } \to$ Isocyanate

$\ce{ -SCN^{-} } \to$ Thiocyanate
$\ce{ -NCS^{-} } \to$ Isothiocyanate


#### Organometallic Compounds 
Carbon of organic group (ligand) is directly attached to metal or metalloid. 
All metals and metalloids like B, Si, Ge, An, Sb, Ge etc. form organometallic compounds.

Noble gases, halogens, O family, N and P do not form organometallic compounds.

Examples of Organometallic compounds are,
$$\ce{ K[PtCl_{3}(\eta^{2}-C_{2}H_{5})], [Fe(\eta^{5}-C_{6}H_{5})2], [Cr(\eta^{6}-C_{6}H_{6})2], (C_{2}H_{5})2Zn, (C_{2}H_{5})4Pb, (CH_{3})3B, (C_{2}H_{5})4Sn etc. }$$
Grignard Reagent, $\ce{ RMgX }$, cyanido and carbonyl complexes are also organometallic compounds.

## Metal Carbonyls
They are of two types, 

##### Monomeric carbonyls 
They are Toxic light coloured liquids. 

Examples are, #important

- $\ce{ [Cr(CO)6]: d^{2}sp^{3} }$, diamagnetic 
- $\ce{ [Fe(CO)5]: dsp^{3} (TBP) }$, diamagnetic

### Synergic Bonding in Carbonyl Compounds 
$\sigma$ and $\pi$ bonds between CM and CO ligand. This combination if called synergetic bonding.

In Carbonyl compounds CO ligand forms $\sigma$ bond by donating a lone pair to vacant hybrid orbital of metal. At the same time fully filled d orbital of CM overlaps with the $\pi ^{*}$ LUMO and donates lp through $\pi$ [[08 Hybridisation#Back Bonding|back donation]].

Thus bond order becomes more than one between M-C.

![[Pasted image 20230721203316.png]]

 Stronger is the synergic bond between M and CO, the weaker will be the C-O bond ins metal carbonyl. Thus in carbonyl compounds CO bond length is longer than that in free CO. 
 
 This is because C cannot expand its octet, i.e. cannot make more than 4 bonds. $\ce{ C#O }$ already has 3 bonds between C and O and  thus if a bond of more than 1 BO forms between M and C, the BO between C and O becomes lesser than 3.

##### Strength of Synergetic Bonding
Greater is the tendency of M to donate lp to vacant $\pi ^{*}$ LUMO of  CP ligand, greater will be the strength of synergetic bond. 

Order of tendency to donate lp,
$$\ce{ M- > M > M+ }$$
Thus the decreasing strength of synergic bonda and increasing C-O bond strength.

$\ce{ M- }$ is formed when there is NO or CO as they are good reducing agents.
