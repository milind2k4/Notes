# Splitting of d orbitals in Octahedral Field (CN = 6)

Imagine the metal atom to be at the body centre of an imaginary cube.

The $e_{g}$ orbitals face towards the face centres and the $t_{2g}$ orbitals face towards the edge centres. 

Ligands approach octahedrally from face centres. Thus, the $e_{g}$ orbitals face more repulsion (at 0$^{\circ}$) and their energy is increased as compared to $t_{2g}$ which face lesser repulsion (at 45$^{\circ}$). 

Thus the degenerate d orbitals split into two sets $t_{2g}$ and $e_{g}$ and e fill into them by the Aufbau principle and Hund's Rule. 

The first 3 e go to the $t_{2g}$ orbital but the 4th e may be paired or go to $e_{g}$ orbital depending on the value of pairing energy (P) and difference in energy of the 2 levels which is called *octahedral splitting energy (or simply octahedral splitting)* $\Delta_{o}$.

$$\Delta_{o} = \frac{ hc }{ \lambda } = hc \bar{\nu}$$
where $\lambda$ is wavelength of light and $\bar{\nu}$ is wave number.

Wave number is given by,
$$\bar{\nu} = \frac{ \nu }{ c } = \frac{ f }{ c }$$

If $\Delta_{o} > P$ 4th e will go to $t_{2g}$
If $\Delta_{o} < P$ 4th e will go to $e_{g}$

Spherical crystal field means that there is equal repulsion on each orbital, which is not actually applied. 

P varies but $\Delta_{o}$ varies more depending on various factors. Thus we take P constant and decide configuration based on $\Delta_{o}$.

#### Factors Affecting $\Delta_{o}$

1. [[07 Crystal Field Theory#Spectrochemical Series|Nature of Ligand]]
	   - Strong Field Ligand (SFL) i.e. more splitting, $P < \Delta_{o}$
	   - Weak Field Ligand (WFL) i.e. less splitting, $P > \Delta_{o}$

2. Type of CM
	   - Order of splitting caused: 3d < 4d < 5d
	   - This is because of increasing order of $Z_{eff}$.
	   - Thus CM belongs to 4d or 5d series then WFL also acts as SFL in general.

3. Oxidation state of CM
	- +ve ON of CA $\uparrow \implies Z_{eff} \uparrow \implies \Delta_{o} \uparrow$ 
	- Higher the OS, higher is the probability to form inner orbital complex. (inner d complex).
