# Werner's Coordination Theory

1. Central Atoms are attached to various species which satisfy 2 types of valency,
	   - **Primary Valency**: (*ON*) satisfied by anions and is used in calculation of ON of CA.
	   - **Secondary Valency**: (*CN*) satisfied by Ligands and is used in calculation of coordination number.
		$\\$
1. Secondary Valency are *non ionisable* while primary valency are ionisable
	$\\$

2. Secondary valency are *directional* in nature and thus decide the geometry of complex. 
	$\\$

3. For pictorial representation, primary is shown by *dashed* line and secondary by *solid* line.
	
	In $\ce{ [Co(NH_{3})6]Cl_{3} }$, 6 $\ce{ NH_{3} }$ satisfy secondary valency and 3 $\ce{ Cl- }$ satisfy primary valency.

5. If a species satisfies both primary and secondary then it is shown by a *solid line with a dashed* line above.

## Experiments by Werner
1 mol of $\ce{ CoCl_{2} }$ was take and reacted with various amounts of $\ce{ NH_{3} }$.

To determine the structure of complex salt (establishment of primary and secondary valencies), Werner Conducted certain experiments. 

#### Colligative Property Measurement
Colligative property data suggest that one mole of $\ce{ CoCl_{3}.6NH_{3} }$ breaks into 4 ions. I.e. Van't Hoff factor $i = 4$
Thus, 
$$\ce{ [Co(NH_{3})_{6}]Cl_{3} -> [Co(NH_{3})_{6}]^{3+} + 3Cl^{-} }$$

Colligative property data suggest that one mole of $\ce{ CoCl_{3}.5NH_{3} }$ breaks into 3 ions.
Thus, 
$$\ce{ [Co(NH_{3})_{5}Cl]Cl_{2} -> [Co(NH_{3})_{6}]^{2+} + 2Cl^{-} }$$

#### Chemical Reactions

If $\ce{ CoCl_{3}.6NH_{3} }$ is reacted,
$$\ce{ CoCl_{3}.6NH_{3} ->[\text{excess}][AgNO_{3}] 3\ mol\ AgCl \downarrow (\text{white}) }$$

This can only be explained if the structure is,
$$\ce{ [Co(NH_{3})_{6}]Cl_{3} }$$

Again $\ce{ CoCl_{3}.4NH_{3} }$ is reacted,
$$\ce{ CoCl_{3}.4NH_{3} ->[\text{excess}][AgNO_{3}] 1\ mol\ AgCl \downarrow (\text{white}) }$$
This can only be explained if structure is
$$\ce{ [Co(NH_{3})_{4}Cl_{2}]Cl }$$

Structure can be found using dehydrating reagent also, on the basis that only the water that is outside the CS will be removed (water of crystallisation). The outside water connects through H bonding and is thus easier to remove. 

conc. $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$ is a powerful dehydrating substance. 

$$\ce{ CrCl_{3}.6H_{2}O ->[conc. H_{2}SO_{4}][excess] \text{No increase in mass of} conc. H_{2}SO_{4} }$$

No increase in its mass indicated that there is no water outside the coordination sphere. 
Thus the structure must be,
$$\ce{ [Cr(H_{2}O)6]Cl_{3} }$$

If $\ce{ CrCl_{3}.6H_{2}O }$ is reacted,
$$\ce{ CrCl_{3}.6H_{2}O ->[conc. H_{2}SO_{4}][excess] \text{18 g increase in mass of} conc. H_{2}SO_{4} }$$

This means that 1 mol of $\ce{ H_{2}O }$ is absorbed. 
Thus the structure must be,
$$\ce{ [Cr(H_{2}O)5Cl]Cl_{2}.H_{2}O }$$

Note that $\ce{ [Cr(H_{2}O)3Cl_{3}].3H_{2}O }$ does not exist. This is because $\ce{ [Cr(H_{2}O)3Cl_{3}] }$ is neutral and water does not connect with neutral complexes through H bonding. 

#### Electrical Conductance Measurement 

Electrical conductance is due to ion present in the solution. 

Conductance $\propto$ no of ions
Conductance $\propto$ charge on ion


EC data of aq solution of one mole of $\ce{ CoCl_{3}.6NH_{3} }$ suggest 6 mole unit of charge and 4 mol of charged particles. 

$$\ce{ [Co(NH_{3})_{6}]Cl_{3} -> \underbrace{ [Co(NH_{3})_{6}]^{3+} + 3Cl^{-} }_{ \text{6 mol  unit of charge} } }$$


EC of aq solution of one mole of $\ce{ CoCl_{3}.5NH_{3} }$ suggest 4 mole unit of charge and 3 mol of charged particles.

$$\ce{ [Co(NH_{3})_{5}Cl]Cl_{2} -> \underbrace{ [Co(NH_{3})_{6}]^{2+} + 2Cl^{-} }_{ \text{4 mol unit of charge} } }$$
