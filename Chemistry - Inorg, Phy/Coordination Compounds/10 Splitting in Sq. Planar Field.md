# Splitting of d orbitals in Sq. Planar Field (CN = 4)
4 ligands approach from x and y axis i.e. the 4 face centres (walls of the cube).

Here,
- $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ face repulsions at $0^{\circ}$
- $d_{xy}$ face repulsions at $45^{\circ}$
- $d_{z^{2}}$ face repulsions at $90^{\circ}$ on the lobes and $0^{\circ}$ on the ring in x-y plane. 
- $d_{xy}, d_{yz}$ face repulsions at combination of $45^{\circ}$ and $90^{\circ}$

The d orbitals which lie on the axes i.e. $e_{g}$ face the most repulsion and thus their energy gets increased. But when the ligands come even closer, they split further, as according to the repulsion by the ligands.

Also, it is found that $\Delta_{sp}$ is 30% greater than $\Delta_{o}$,
$$\Delta_{sp} = 1.3 \Delta_{o}$$

Thus,
$$\Delta_{sp} > \Delta_{o} > \Delta_{t}$$


#### Factors Favouring Formation of Sq. Planar Complex
1. Square planar complex are mainly formed by $d^{8}$ (in some cases $d^{7}$ and $d^{9}$) configuration. This is because in $d^{8}$ config 8 e are filled in lower energy orbitals, $d_{xz}, d_{yz}, d_{z^{2}}, d_{xy}$ due to which CFSE released is high which stabilises  the complex.

2. $3d^{8}$ ($\ce{ Ni^{2+} }$) with SFL forms sq. planar complex. Like $\ce{ [Ni(CN)4]^{2-}, [Ni(dmg)2] }$
	$\\$

3. $4d^{8}$ & $5d^{8}$ always form sq. planar complex irrespective of nature of ligand. 

Examples of Sq. Planar complexes, #important 
$$\ce{ [AgF_{4}]-, [AuCl_{4}]-, [PtCl_{4}]^{2-}, \underset{ Wilkinson Catalyst }{ [RhCl(PPh_{3})2] }, [Ni(en)2]^{2+} }$$

Wilkinson catalyst is a homogeneous catalyst used in hydrogenation of alkenes. 

Some Sq. Planar complexes of $d^{7}$ and $d^{9}$,
$$\ce{ [\underset{ d^{9} }{ Cu }(NH_{3})4]^{2+}, [\underset{ d^{7} }{ Co }(Py)4]^{2+}, [\underset{ d^{7} }{ Co }(dmg)2] }$$
