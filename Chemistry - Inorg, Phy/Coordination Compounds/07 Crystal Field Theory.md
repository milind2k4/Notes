# Crystal Field Theory (CFT)
Earlier this theory was used in Physics to study the modification in e config of cation due to the approach of anions considering anions to be -ve point charges. 

Later this theory was extended to coordination compounds where central atom is surrounded by approach of ligands considering ligands to be -ve point charges. This however, is one of the drawbacks of CFT. 

This itself is a drawback of CFT when applied to coordination compounds because interaction between central atom and ligand is covalent or coordinate. While in CFT  the interaction is taken as interaction considering anion (ligand) to be -ve point charges. 

### Postulates 
1. Ligands are treated as point charge in case of anion and dipole in case of neutral molecule. 

2. Ligands approach the central atom and cause repulsion to the orbitals Central Atom

3. Due to approach of ligands towards central atom the energy of outer orbital gets modified.

1. Out of the various outer orbital facing repulsion due to ligands, the repulsion faced by d is most significant as most of the coordination compounds use d block metal as central atom.

#### Shapes of d orbitals
![[Shapeofdorbital.jpg]]

$d_{xy}, d_{yz}, d_{zx}$ are called $t_{2g}$ orbitals. (Triply degenerate gerade orbitals, where grade means "even")
Their lobes are between axes. 
There are 12 lobes in total, pointing towards edge centres.

$d_{z^{2}}, d_{z^{2}-y^{2}}$ are called $e_{g}$ orbitals. (Axial degenerate gerade orbitals) 
Their lobes are on the axes. 
There are 6 lobes in total, pointing towards face centres.

### Spectrochemical Series
Strength of various ligands are experimentally determined and arranged in increasing order of splitting caused and this series is called **spectrochemical series.**

The ligands up to water are considered to be WFL and beyond are SFL in general. However exceptions may be there based on other factors. 

In general ligands with O, X and S donors are WFL and with N, P, C are SFL.

#### WFL
$\ce{ I^{-} < Br^{-} < S^{2-} < SCN < Cl^{-} < NO^{-} < N_{3}^{-} < F^{-} < OH^{-} < ox < H_{2}O }$

#### SFL
$\ce{ < NCS^{-} < EDTA^{4-} < NCCH_{3} < py < NH_{3} < en < bipy < NO_{2}^{-} < PPh_{3} < CN^{-} < CO }$

### Some Exceptions in CFT
#important 

With $\ce{ Co^{3+} }$, many WFL (like water, ox etc.) act as SFL. And form $d^{2}sp^{3}$ (low spin complex) in CN = 6. 

Examples, #important 
$$\ce{ \underset{ d^{6}, dia, d^{2}sp^{3} }{ [Co(H_{2}O)6]^{3+} }, \underset{ d^{6}, dia, d^{2}sp^{3} }{ [Co(C_{2}O_{4})3]^{3-} }, \underset{ para, sp^{3}d^{2} }{ [CoF_{6}]^{3-} } }$$
F is very very WFL. 


With $\ce{ NH_{3} }$, $\ce{ Co^{2+}, Fe^{2+}, Mn^{2+} }$ form high spin complex ($sp^{3}d^{2}$) in CN = 6. And thus ammonia behaves as WFL. Thus in lower OS, some SFL behave as WFL.

$$\ce{ [\overset{ d^{7} }{ Co }(NH_{3})6]^{2+} }$$
$$\ce{ [\overset{ d^{6} }{ Fe }(NH_{3})6]^{2+} }$$
$$\ce{ [\overset{ d^{5} }{ Mn }(NH_{3})6]^{2+} }$$


Similarly, in high OS, some WFL behave as SFL.
- $\ce{ [\overset{ +2 }{ Ni }F_{6}]^{4-} }$ is $sp^{3}d^{2}$
- $\ce{ [\overset{ +4 }{ Ni }F_{6}]^{2-} }$ here F behaves as SFL as Ni is in high OS. Thus it is $d^{2}sp^{3}$ complex.
