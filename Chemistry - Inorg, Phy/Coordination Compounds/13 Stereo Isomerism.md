# Stereo Isomerism 
It is the same as in [[04 Stereo Isomerism]] in organic chemistry. 

Same formula and connectivity but orientation in space is different. 

##### Notation of Ligands
- Monodentate: a, b, c, d....
- Bidentate: 
	  - symmetric: (AA), (BB), (CC) ….
	  - asymmetric: (AB), (CD) ….

Donor atoms of bidentate ligands always occupy cis position around CA. Bidentate ligands cannot stretch enough to occupy the trans position. 

### Tetrahedral (CN = 4)
1. They can't show Geometrical Isomerism.
2. They can show Optical isomerism when all 4 valencies are different (i.e. no Plane of Symmetry or Centre of Symmetry)

Only those which have all 4 donor atoms different will show OI.

($\ce{ M(AB)2 }$ shows OI because it does not have both rings in the same plane regardless of how we cut)

### Sq. Planar (CH = 4)
1. They cannot show Optical Isomerism because they always have a plane of symmetry. 
2. They can only show Geometrical Isomerism (i.e can show cis and trans)

We can check the number of GI by making trans pairs. If there is only one trans pair, then the compound does not show GI.

### Octahedral (CN = 6)
Octahedral complexes may show Geometrical Isomerism as well as Optical isomerism.

All 6 positions are identical. The bond angle can be either 90 or 180. 
There are 12 90$^{\circ}$ and 3 180$^{\circ}$ angles. 

Here we use fac and mer terminology.
Out of 8 triangular faces in octahedron, if two faces have their vertices occupied by same ligands, then it will be **facial (fac)** isomer otherwise **meridional (mer)** isomer.  

If there is any plane of symmetry, then the molecule will not show OI. 

There is a shortcut to finding if a compound shows OI.

> For monodentate ligands, if in the trans pairs made for the compound, any two brackets are the same, or if both the ligands in one bracket are the same, then it will have a plane of symmetry and thus will not show OI.

> If there are two Bidentate ligands which are not in the same plane, they will show OI.
