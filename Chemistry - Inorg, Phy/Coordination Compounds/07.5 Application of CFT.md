# Application of CFT
### Colour
In general the compound which absorbs one of the wavelengths of visible light is coloured. 

A complimentary colour is visible which is found by using colour circle.

If Blue light is absorbed, then colour of compound appears orange. 

For solving questions, in general compounds with zero unpaired e are colourless (which is also taken white). However, this is not a rule and many compounds show colour despite being diamagnetic. 

#### d-d transitions
In d block metal complexes, for $d^{1} - d^{9}$ config colour is mainly due to d-d transition. 

e jumps from $t_{2g}$ to $e_{g}$ after absorbing light. If this light absorbed lies in the visible region then the compound is coloured. 
This is d-d transition.

If ligands are removed by some method,
$$\ce{ \underset{ purple }{ [Ti(H_{2}O)6]Cl_{3} } ->[\Delta] \underset{ colourless }{ TiCl_{3} } }$$
Thus in absence of ligands, there is no d-d transitions. 

#### Charge Transfer
Colour of $d^{0}$ and $d^{10}$ is not due to d-d transition as all the orbitals are either empty in the first and completely full in the second case. 
Many compounds with $d^{0}$ and $d^{10}$ config are found to be coloured which is due to **charge transfer spectra or e transfer spectra.** 

For example,
$$\ce{ \underset{ purple }{ K\overset{ d^{0} }{ Mn }O_{4} }, \underset{ orange }{ K_{2}\overset{ d^{0} }{ Cr }_{2}O_{7} }, \underset{ orange }{ \overset{ d^{10} }{ Sn }I_{4} }, \underset{ brown }{ [\overset{ d^{7} }{ Fe }(H_{2}O)5(NO+)]SO_{4} } }$$
Colour in these complexes is due to charge transfer from ligand to metal (CTLM).

In **CTLM,** Charge (e) is transferred from oxido ligand to Mn or Cr in the first two on absorption of light. 

There is also **CRML** in which charge is transferred from metal to ligand. 
Examples are $\ce{ [Fe(CO)5], [Cr(\eta^{6}-C_{6}H_{6})2], [Fe(\eta^{5}-C_{5}H_{5})2] }$

### Magnetic Behaviour 
If there are no unpaired e, then the substance is **diamagnetic** which are weakly repelled under magnetic field and *show a slight decrease in **weight** in magnetic balance.* 

If there are unpaired e, then the substance is **paramagnetic** which are weakly attracted by magnetic field and show *slight increase in **weight** in magnetic balance.*

Also, spin magnetic moment,
$$\mu = \sqrt{ x(x + 1) }\ BM$$
where x is the number of unpaired e.

### Thermodynamic Stability 
[[00 Ionic Equilibrium#Complexation Equilibrium]]

Higher is the $k_{f}$ value, the more thermodynamically stable the complex is. 

#### Factors affecting Stability
- With same ligands and same number of ligands, $\ce{ M^{3+} }$ forms more stable complex than $\ce{ M^{2+} }$. 
  
  This is because $\ce{ M^{3+} }$ has smaller size and  thus forms stronger bonds with ligands as $\ce{ M^{3+} }$ is stronger Lewis acid than $\ce{ M^{2+} }$. 
  
  Thus, in terms of stability,
  $$\ce{ Co^{3+} > Co^{2+} }$$
	If other conditions are the same.
	$\\$

- Order of stability of complexes formed:
  $$\ce{ Mn^{2+} < Fe^{2+} < Co^{2+} < Ni^{2+} < Cu^{2+} > Zn^{2+} }$$
  (with same ligands and same number of ligands)
  
  This is called **Irwin William Series.** It is based on size. 
  $\ce{ Cu^{2+} }$ is more stable than $\ce{ Zn^{2+} }$ is because it is smaller in size. 
  $\\$

- **Chelate Effect or Entropic Effect:** If a ligand forms chelate, then complex is more stable.
  Thus complex with greater number of chelating rings are more stable. 
  
  $$\ce{ [M(NH_{3})6]^{3+} + 3 en -> [M(en)3]^{3+} + 6NH_{3} }$$
  Since here $\Delta n_{g}$ is +ve, $\Delta S$ (entropy) is highly +ve and thus, 
  $$\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S$$
  is highly -ve and hence, the reaction is spontaneous. 
  $$\ce{ [M(en)3]^{3+} > [M(NH_{3})6]^{3+} }$$
