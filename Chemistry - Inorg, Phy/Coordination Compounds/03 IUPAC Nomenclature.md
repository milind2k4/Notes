# IUPAC Nomenclature
### Naming of Anionic Ligands
Name ends with "o" after removing "e"

ide $\to$ ido
ite $\to$ ito
ate $\to$ ato

[[03.5 Ligand Name Tables#Anionic Ligands]]

### Naming of Neutral Ligand
Name of neutral ligand remains unchanged except in a few cases where special names are used. 

[[03.5 Ligand Name Tables#Neutral Ligands]]

### Naming of Cationic Ligand
Name ends with "-ium" suffix.

[[03.5 Ligand Name Tables#Cationic Ligands]]

### Naming of Central Atom
Name of central atom remains unchanged if it appears in cationic part of complex or neutral complex. 

Name is modified by replacing '-ium' with '-ate'. if it is present in anionic part of complex. 

In cases where there is Greek word, it is used when the complex part is anion. (i.e. +ve ion attached)

### Rules of Naming Complex Compound

1. Name of Cationic part is written first. A space is left between the cation and anion names. 
   $\\$

2. While writing the name of the complex part naming of ligands is done first in the alphabetical order, prefixed with number denoting prefixes which are not counted into the alphabetical order. (di, tri etc)
   $\\$

3. If ligands are organic, then the prefixes bis, tris tetrakis etc is used, with the name of ligand in parenthesis.
   $\\$

4. Name of central atom is written after ligands with it's Oxidation State inside parenthesis. 
   $\\$

5. If more than one type of counter ions are present then number denoting prefixes are used. 
	   - E.g. in $\ce{ K_{4}[Fe(CN)_{6}] }$, Potassium will be used.
	   - E.g. in $\ce{ K_{2}Na_{2}[Fe(CN)_{6}] }$, Dipotassium and Disodium will be used.

Examples, common names of complexes of iron are important. 
(Potassium frrocyanide, Pottasium ferricyanide)

If there are more than one Coordination sphere, the most common of the CM are chosen. 
- Co, Cr: +2, +3
- Fe: +2, +3
- Pt: +2, +4
- Ni: +2, +4
- B: +3
- Be: +2
- Al, Sc: +3 
- Al, Cd: +2




#### Some Important Complexes
- *Prussian Blue* is $\ce{ Fe_{4}[Fe(CN)6]3 }$ i.e. Ferri ferrocyanide. 
- *Tunnbull's Blue* is $\ce{ Fe_{3}[Fe(CN)6]2 }$ i.e. Ferro ferricyanide. 
- *Sodium Nitroprusside* is $\ce{ Na_{2}[Fe(CN)5(NO+)] }$
- *Brown ring Complex* is $\ce{ [Fe(H_{2}O)5(NO+)]SO_{4} }$ in which Fe is in +1 O.S.. 

In Sodium Nitroprusside and Brown ring complex, $\ce{ NO+ }$ is a ligand which is sometimes written like $\ce{ NO }$. We have to take $\ce{ NO+ }$ but only in these two cases.

### Naming of Bridged Complexes 
A bridge complex is one which contains at least one bridging ligands. 

**Bridging Ligands:** Ligands which are connected to two central atoms. E.g. $\ce{ \underset{ imide }{ NH^{2-} }, \underset{ amide }{ NH_{2}- }, OH-, O_{2}-, H-, O_{2}^{2-}, CO }$ etc. 

Examples of Bridged ligands are,
$$\ce{ [Co(NH_{3})5-OH-Cr(H_{2}O)5]Cl_{5} }$$
where $\ce{ OH- }$ is bridging ligand here. 

$$\ce{ K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7} }$$
![[Pasted image 20230717192713.png]]

A prefix $\mu$ is applied before the name of bridging ligand. The rest naming scheme is the same. 
Thus,

$$\ce{ [\overset{ +3 }{ Co }(NH_{3})5-OH-\overset{ +3 }{ Cr }(H_{2}O)5]Cl_{5} }$$
will be called $\mu$-hydroxido-pentaammine-cobalt(III)-pentaaqua-chromium(III) chloride.
We can also write the name in the order it is present in,
pentaammine-cobalt(III)-$\mu$-hydroxido-pentaaqua-chromium(III) chloride


$$\ce{ Cr_{2}O_{7}^{2-} }$$
will be called $\mu$-hydroxido-bis(trioxido-chromate(III)) ion, since it is symmetrical in structure. 

![[Pasted image 20230717193959.png]]
will be called $\mu$-ammido-$\mu$-hydroxido-tetraaqua-cobalt(III)-bis(ethylenediamine)-chromium(III) sulphate

### Naming of $\pi$ bonded Complex
In $\pi$  bonded complex, $\pi$ e density is donated to the central atom by $\pi$ e containing ligands.

Here in writing formula $\eta^{x}$ is used where $x$ represents the number of carbon atoms in a ligand in which $\pi$ e density is distributed. $\eta$ is not used while writing name. 

So, 
$$\ce{ [Cr(\eta^{6}-C_{6}H_{6})_{2}] }$$
has IUAC name, Bis(benzene) chromium(0)
Which has a sandwiched structure,
![[Pasted image 20230717195142.png]]

$$\ce{ [Fe(\eta^{5}-C_{5}H_{5})_{2}] }$$
has IUAC name, Bis(cyclopentadianyl) iron(II) (**Ferrocene**)
which has a sandwiched structure,
![[Pasted image 20230717195308.png]]

$$\ce{ K[PtCl_{3}(\eta^{2}-C_{2}H_{4})] }$$
has name, Pottasium trichlorido ethylene platinate(II) (**Zese's Salt**)
The bond length in ethylene is lesser than double bond as the $\pi$ e density is donated to CM

Zese's Salt has structure,
