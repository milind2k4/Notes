# Splitting of d orbitals in Tetrahedral Field (CN = 4)
Ligands approach from alternate corners. 

Also tetrahedral orbitals are not gerade (g) as they are not symmetrical and thus we do not put $_{g}$ in the names of orbitals. 

The $e$ orbitals bisect the angle between the approaching ligands and  thus face less repulsion. As $t_{2}$ orbitals are closer to the corners, they face more repulsion as compared to $e$ orbitals.

Here,
$$\Delta_{t} = \frac{4}{9} \Delta_{o}$$
$\Delta_{t}$ is much lower than $\Delta_{o}$ because,
1. Only 4 ligands approach in tetrahedral field than the 6 in octahedral approach. (4/6 factor)
2. No direct repulsion at zero degree is faced by any orbital. (another 4/6 factor).

CFSE is calculated as,
$$CFSE = 0.4 \Delta_{t} n_{t_{2}} - 0.6 \Delta_{t} n_{e}$$

#### Factors Favouring Formation of Tetrahedral Complex
1. Generally WFL and bulky ligands ($\ce{ PPh_{3}, I^{-}, PMe_{3} }$) form tetrahedral complexes because $\Delta_{t}$ is very low.

2. Generally $\ce{ d^{0}, d^{10}}$ always form $sp^{3}$ complex. 
   $\\$

3. Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn  
   with oxido ligand (which have +2 OS on oxygen donor atom) form tetrahedral complex.  Like $\ce{ VO_{4}^{3-}, MnO_{4}-, MnO_{4}^{2-}, FeO_{4}^{2-} }$
   
   with WFL and bulky ligands form tetrahedral complex like $\ce{ TiCl_{4}, [ZnCl_{4}]^{2-}, [Cu(CN)4]^{3-}, [NiCl_{4}]^{2-}, [MnCl_{4}]-, [Ni(CO)4], [NiCl_{2}(PPh_{3})2] }$
   $\\$

Exception:  $\ce{ [NiCl_{2}(PMe_{3})_{2}] }$ is sq. planar
