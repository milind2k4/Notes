# Valence Bond Theory (VBT)
#### Postulates
1. Metals provides hybridised empty orbital or accepting lp of e from ligands to form coordinate bonds. 

2. Number of empty orbital undergoing hybridisation depends on the coordination number.

3. Shape and geometry of the complex depends upon CN.

### [[08.5 Geometry and Shape|Hybridisation Tables]]

The d orbitals written first are from the penultimate (n-1) shell, the s and p orbitals are from valence (n) shell and the d orbitals written later are from the valence shell (n).

Those which have $d$ at the right hand side are called Outer Orbital Complex or High Spin Complex

Those which have $d$ at the left hand side are called Inner Orbital Complex or Low Spin Complex (due to pairing)

$d^{3}s$ hybridisation is generally observed with $d^{0}$ configuration of CA as in, $\ce{ TiCl_{4}, MnO_{4}-, CrO_{4}^{2-}, VO_{4}^{3-} etc. }$

[[00 Coordination Compounds#Metal Carbonyl Synergetic Bonding]]
In addition of $\sigma$ coordinate bond formed between ligand and CA (by lp donation to CA), in some cases, ligands accept a lp from fully filled d orbital of CA through **$\pi$ back donation.** Such ligands are called **$\pi$-acids or $\pi$-acceptors.** 
Some examples are $\ce{ CO, CN-, PH_{3}, PPh_{3}, PF_{3}, PCl_{3}, C_{2}H_{4}, C_{2}H_{2}, NO etc. }$

### Finding Hybridisation
In case of CN = 2 or 3, no additional info in needed for predicting hybridisation and shape of complex, but for CN = 4,5,6 additional info is required. This is one of the drawbacks of VBT.

(this extra info is "strong" and "weak" ligand where strong cause pairing of e)

Note that if the CM has high $Z_{eff}$ (like Au) the e will pair up. 

In general, the info needed are either,
1. No of unpaired e in complex

	No of unpaired e in complex = sum of no of unpaired e of ligands and CM.
	Generally ligands don't have unpaired e. Except, $\ce{ NO(1), O_{2}(2), O_{2}^{-}(1) }$
	
	Spin Magnetic Moment = $\sqrt{ x(x+1) }$ BM, where x is number of unpaired e.
	$\\$

2. Info about dipole moment

Sometimes paired e in one of the orbitals will be sent into one of the inner orbitals to form vacant hybrid orbitals,

However, there cannot be any unnecessary pairing,
