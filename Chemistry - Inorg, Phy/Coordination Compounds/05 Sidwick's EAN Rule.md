# Sidwick's EAN Rule
aka **18 e Rule**

1. EAN: **Effective Atomic Number.** which is Atomic no. of CA ON + no. of e gained by CA with various ligands.
   $\\$

2. It was made based on some complexes and does not have any scientific basis and therefore fails in most cases. 
   $\\$

3. According to this rule, if EAN of CM in a complex compound is equal to the atomic number of nearest noble gas then the complex is considered stable. 
   $\\$
   
1. This rule fails in most complexes but it is still very well applicable on metal carbonyls (CO) and nitrosyls (NO) with very few exceptions. #important 

#### Calculating EAN
EAN  = Atomic no of CM - ON + Total no of e donated by ligands 

We can find Atomic number by,

E.g.
$\ce{ [Fe(CN)_{6}]^{4-} }$: EAN = 26 - 2 + 6 * 2 = 36
Thus it is stable as Kr(36)

$\ce{ [Pt(en)_{2}]Cl_{2} }$: EAN = 78 - 2 + 4 * 2 = 84
Thus it is not stable according to EAN rule. 
However, it was found to be stable, proving EAN rule wrong.

All $\pi$ e are counted when calculating EAN of a $\pi$ bonded complex like ferrocene. 
$\ce{ [Fe(\eta^{5}-C_{5}H_{5})] }$: EAN = 26 - 2 + 6 * 2 = 36

$\ce{ [Cr-(\eta^{6}-C_{6}H_{6})] }$: EAN = 24 - 0 + 6 * 2 = 36

Nitrosyl group is a three electron donor, whereas $\ce{ NO+ }$ is a 2 e donor. #important 
This is found by reactions.
$$\ce{ [Fe(CO)5] + 2NO -> [Fe(CO)2(NO)2] + 3 CO }$$
$$\ce{ [Cr(CO)6] + 4 No -> [Cr(NO)4] + 6 CO }$$
Here we can see that 3 CO are displaced by 2 NO ligands. Thus 6 e from 2 NO is obtained i.e. NO donates 3 e. 
This is the reason why nitrosyls follow EAN. 

##### NO and CO follow EAN rule
$\ce{ [Mn(CO)5] }$: EAN = 25 - 0 + 5 * 2 = 35.
Thus it does not follow EAN rule. It also does not exist as a monomeric carbonyl (carbonyl which has single centre). It actually exists as a dimer or anionic form. 

In the dimer form it has a metal-metal covalent bond and in anion, it has a -1 OS on Mn.

$\ce{ [Co(NO)4] }$: EAN = 27 - 0 + 4 * 2 = 35
Thus it does not follow EAN. This monomeric carbonyl does not exit. 
It exists as a dimer or anion.

This fact can be used to find number of counter ions. #important

There is however, **an exception,**
$\ce{ [V(CO)6] }$: EAN = 23 - 0 + 12 = 35
Thus it does not follow EAN rule, yet it exists. However, it is not very stable in monomeric form.
