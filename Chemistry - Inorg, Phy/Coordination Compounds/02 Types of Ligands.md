# Types of Ligands based on Denticity 

### Monodentate 
no of coordinate bonds with CM is ***one***
Examples: 
$\ce{ NH_{3}, NH_{2}^{-}, NH^{2-}, N_{3}^{-}, X^{-}, PH_{3}, H_{2}O, CO, OH^{-}, \text{Phenol, Pyridine, Triphenyl Phospene} (PPh_{3}) }$

To become a donor atom there should be proper orientation and proximity of donor atoms. 
Azide ion cannot act as monodentate as it does have proper proximity.

### Bidentate 
no of coordinate bonds with CM is ***two***
Examples:  
- *ethylenediamine* (en): two N are donor, symmetrical.
- *propylene diamine* (pn): two N are donor, asymmetric.
- *acetylacetonate* (acac): two O donor, symmetric mono-anionic.
- *2,2-bipyridine* (bipy): two N donor, symmetric.
- *1,10-phenanthroline/o-phenanthroline* (phen, o-phen): two N donor, symmetric.
- *oxalate* (ox): two O are donor, symmetric di-anionic
- *glycinate* (gly): N and O are donor, asymmetric mono-anionic.
- *urea*: two N are donor symmetric.

- *trimethylene diamine* (tn): two N are donor, symmetric. (isomer of pn)

- *caticol* acts as bidentate ligand, but resorcinol and quinol only act as monodentate ligands.

- ***dimethyl glyoximate*** (dmg H$^{-}$, dmg): two N are donor asymmetric mono-anionic. Here N is donor because it is less EN than O. #important

  It reacts with $\ce{ Ni^{2+} }$ to form a red ppt called **Rosy Red**
  $$\ce{ Ni^{2+} + dmgH_{2} ->[NH_{4}OH] [Ni(dmgH)2] v or [Ni(dmg)2] v }$$
  This has structure,
  ![[Rosy red.png]]
  
  This molecule has two intramolecular H bonds. 
  The hybridisation of $\ce{ Ni^{2+} }$ is $dsp^{2}$ and it has Square Planar Structure about $\ce{ Ni^{2+} }$.


### Flexidentate Ligand
Some ligands like $\ce{ SO_{4}^{2-}, S_{2}O_{3}^{2-}, CO_{3}^{2-} }$ etc. can act as monodentate as well as monodentate as well as bidentate ligands. These ligands are called **Flexidentate.**

### Tridentate
no of coordinate bonds with CM is ***three***

*Diethylene triamine* (dien)
$\ce{ H_{2}N-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-NH-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-NH_{2} }$

![[Pasted image 20230714130915.png]]

Two chelating rings are formed.

### Tetradentate
no of coordinate bonds with CM is ***four***

*Triethylene tetraamine* (trien)
$\ce{ H_{2}N-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-NH-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-NH-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-NH_{2} }$

![[Pasted image 20230714131047.png]]

3 Chelating rings are formed.

*Ethylene diamine diacetate ion* (EDDA$^{2-}$)
![[Pasted image 20230714132425.png]]

### Hexadentate 
no of coordinate bonds with CM is ***six***

*Ethylene diamine tetra acetate ion* (EDTA$^{4-}$)
EDTA is Ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid. 

The ion of which has structure, which is ligand.
![[Pasted image 20230714131343.png]]
(atoms with * are donor)

It forms complex which is optically active.

#### EDTA's Uses and Derivatives
Calcium salt of EDTA is used in treatment of lead poisoning.
Sodium salt of EDTA is used to remove $\ce{ Ca^{2+}, Mg^{2+} }$ from hard water. 

There are 3 similar compounds,
- EDTA: Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid which loses 4 H to form $\ce{ EDTA^{4-} }$.
- ED3A: Ethylene diamine triacetic acid which loses 3 H to form $\ce{ ED 3A^{3-} }$, a pentadentate ligand.
- EDDA: Ethylene diamine diacetic acid which loses 2 H to form $\ce{ EDDA^{2-} }$, a tetradentate ligand.
