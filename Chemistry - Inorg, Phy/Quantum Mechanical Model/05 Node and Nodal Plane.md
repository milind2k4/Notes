# Node & Nodal Plane
#important 

Nodal Plane is also called Nodal Surface. 

**Node:** it is a plane or surface where probability of finding e is zero. i.e. **at node, $\psi^{2} = 0$**

Total number of nodes is an orbital = *$n-1$*

There are two types of nodes,
1. **Radial/Spherical:** is a spherical shell occurring at a finite distance from the nucleus, where radial probability of finding e is zero, i.e. **$\psi_{r}^{2} = 0$**
   
   Number of Radial Nodes in an orbital = *$n-l-1$*

1. **Angular:** is a plane or surface through nucleus where angular probability of finding e is zero, i.e. $\psi_{(\theta,\phi)}^{2}=0$

   Number of Angular Nodes in an orbital = *$l$*
   thus, for 
	- s orbital, there are no angular nodes
   
	- p orbital, there is one angular node.

	- d orbital, there are 2 angular nodes

	  for $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ nodal planes are $y = x\ \&\ y = -x$
	  for $d_{z^{2}}$ the nodal planes are not planes but conical.
