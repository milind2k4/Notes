# Quantum Numbers
#### Principal ($n$)
1. Proposed by Bohr and it assumes all the +ve integral values designating **Shell**
   $\\$

1. Shells are imaginary spheres that contain sub-shells and inside sub-shells are orbitals.
	However, shells and sub-shells have no physical significance.
	
	$n = 1,2,3,4 \dots$
	$\text{shell} = K,L,M,N \dots$
   $\\$

1. $n$ determines the size and to a large extent energy of an orbital. However, for multi-e species, energy of an orbital depends on $n$ and $l$ both. 

	Generally, $n \uparrow \implies \text{size of orbital} \uparrow$
   $\\$

1. It also decides the number of orbitals in a shell.
	$$\text{no of orbitals in nth shell} = n^{2}$$
	for example, 3rd shell has 9 orbitals. 
   $\\$

1. And the number of electrons in a shell.
	$$\text{no of e in nth shell} = 2n^{2}$$
	because one orbital can accommodate a max. of 2 electrons. 

#### Azimuthal ($l$)
aka **Orbital Angular Momentum Q. Number** and **Subsidiary Q. Number**

1. Proposed by Sommerfeld and it identifies sub-shell. 
   $\\$

1. It assumes all the +ve integral values **from 0 to n-1**, including 0.
   
	$l = 0,1,2,3 \dots$
	$\text{sub-shell} = s,p,d,f \dots$
   $\\$

1. It determines the shape and energy of an orbital.
   $\\$

1. Number of sub-shells in nth shell = $n$
	e.g. number of sub-shells in 3rd shell = 3
	$$
	\begin{split}
	\ce{ 
	n = 1 &,\ l = 0 (1s) \\ 
	n = 2 &,\ l = 0 (2s), 1 (2p) \\ 
	n = 3 &,\ l = 0 (3s), 1 (3p), 2 (3d) \\ 
	n = 4 &,\ l = 0 (4s), 1 (4p), 2 (4d), 3 (4f) \\ 
	}
	\end{split}
	$$
	s subshell starts with 1s 
	p subshell starts with 2p 
	d subshell starts with 3d 
	f subshell starts with 4f 
   $\\$

1. Orbital angular momentum  = $\displaystyle \sqrt{ l(l+1) } \frac{ h }{ 2\pi } = \sqrt{ l(l+1) } \hbar$. Where $\hbar = \displaystyle \frac{ h }{ 2\pi }$
   $\\$

1. Number of orbitals in a subshell = $2l+1$
	Maximum number of e in a subshell = $2(2l+1)$
   $\\$

1. For **single e species**, energy of an orbital depends only on $n$.
	Thus, $ns = np = nd = nf$
   $\\$

1. For **multi e species**, energy of an orbital depends on $n$ and $l$. This is generally known as $(n+l)$ rule. 
	In general, $ns < np < nd < nf$.
	I.e. for same $n$, $l \uparrow \implies E \uparrow$

#### Magnetic ($m$)
1. Proposed by Goudsmit and Vellenback and it determines orientation of an orbital.
	Each orientation represents an orbital.
   $\\$

1. It assumes all the integral values **from $-l$ to $+l$** including 0.
	Thus the total number of orientations (i.e. total number of orbitals in a subshell) = $2l + 1$

	For $p$ subshell, $m = -1,0,+1$ these 3 values correspond to 3 orbitals of p-subshell. ($p_{x}, p_{y}, p_{z}$). $p_{z}$ is zero, the rest could be any.

	For $d$ subshell, $m = -2,-1,0,+1,+2$ which are, $d_{xy}, d_{yz}, d_{zx}, d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}, d_{z^{2}}$. $d_{z^{2}}$ is zero, the others could be any.
   $\\$

1. These orbitals inside a subshell (s, p, d, f) in absence of any external electric or magnetic field are **degenerate** i.e. having equal energy.
	e.g. $2p_{x} = 2p_{y} = 2p_{z}$

#### Spin ($s$)
1. It was observed experimentally on the basis of spin of e about its own  axis. Similar to the earth spinning about its own axis.
   $\\$

1. Possible values are $\ce{ +1/2 and - 1/2 }$, which are represented by **spin up ($\uparrow$)** and **spin down ($\downarrow$)**. 
   $\\$

1. Spin angular momentum of e is a constant value and is equal to $\sqrt{ s(s+1) } \hbar$ where $s = 1 /2$. (this $s$ is not the Q. no.)
	Thus spin angular momentum of e is $\displaystyle \frac{ \sqrt{ 3 }h }{ 4\pi }$
   $\\$

1. An orbital can accommodate a max. of 2 e of opposite spins. This is called being **Spin Paired** represented as $\fbox{\uparrow \downarrow}$ . If they are of the same spins they are called **Spin Parallel** represented as $\fbox{\uparrow\uparrow}$ which is not possible. 

## Shape of Orbitals
Light and Dark Green indicate the sign of wave function $\psi$.

*Non-directional* means that if we go in any direction from the nucleus, at the same distance, the probability of finding electron is the same. All orbitals except s are directional.

1. s-orbital is spherical in shape and is non-directional.

1. p-orbitals are dumbbell shaped and are directional. They have 2 lobes of equal size.

	$\\$

1. d-orbitals are double dumbbell shaped (except $d_{z^{2}}$ which is donut shaped) and are directional. In $d_{xy}, d_{yz}, d_{zx}$ max. e density lies between the axes. In $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}, d_{z^{2}}$ e density lies along the axes. In $d_{z^{2}}$ the ring has -ve $\psi$ and the lobes have +ve $\psi$.

	($d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ goes through x and y axes)

3. f-orbitals are weirdly shaped
