# Electronic Configuration of Elements
$$nl^{x}$$
where,
$n \to$ Principal Q. No.
$l \to$ Azimuthal Q. No.
$x \to$ No. of electrons in the subshell

Electronic Configuration of an element is written based on the three rules, (i). Pauli's, (ii). Aufbau, (iii). Hund's

However, there are some exceptions, some of which can be explained by the fact that half filled orbitals, especially d and f subshells. 

nth shell is called the ***Outermost Shell***
(n-1)th shell is called the ***Penultimate Shell***
(n-2)th shell is called the ***Anti-Penultimate Shell***
### Ionic e-config
**Cations** are formed by removing e from neutral atom. 
In general, e are removed from outermost orbital of highest energy. 

However, in d block elements e are first removed from $ns$ orbital and then from $(n-1)d$ orbital.

And Hund's rule cannot be violated.

**Anions** are formed by adding e to neutral atoms. 

The e should be added like any other, following the 3 rules. 

### Exceptional EC of Cr and Cu
$$\ce{ Cr: [Ar] 3d^{5} 4s^{1} }$$
$$\ce{ Cu: [Ar] 3d^{10} 4s^{1} }$$

These exceptions are attributed to the following two factors,
1. *Symmetrical Distribution of e:* generally, symmetry provides stability and half filled and fully filled subshells are symmetric. 
   
   Since the energy difference between 3d and 4s is low, e fills into d instead of going into s. 
   $\\$

2. *Exchange Energy:* it is found that **similar spin e** of a subshell (i.e. degenerate orbitals) undergo exchanges (exchange positions) and release energy called exchange energy. 
   
   Greater are the number of exchanges, grater will be the exchange energy and hence stability. 
   
   In a $3d^{5}$ config,
   No of exchanges of 1st e: 4
   No of new exchanges of 2st e: 3
   .
   .
   So, total number of exchanges = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 10
   
   In general, number of exchanges between similar spin e in a subshell, = **$\displaystyle \frac{ n(n+1) }{ 2 }$**, where n is the number of similar spin electrons.
