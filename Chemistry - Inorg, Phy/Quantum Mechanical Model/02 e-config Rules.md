### Pauli's Exclusion Principal 
No two electron in a species can have all four quantum numbers identical. 

An orbital can accommodate a maximum of 2 electrons of opposite spin. i.e. $\fbox{\uparrow \downarrow}$

### Aufbau's Rule
It is a rule about the relative energies of various orbitals in an atom.

According to this rule, e are progressively filled in increasing order of energy of orbitals. 

This is also called **$(n+l)$ rule.** Which states that the **more is the sum of $n$ and $l$, the more is the energy**. If two orbitals have the same $n+l$ value, then the energy of the orbital with lower n is less. 

The energies of various orbitals (or subshells) are represented diagrammatically,

Since there are no elements which have e in 6f, it is not needed to write it.

However, these energies are not constant. As the e are filled up, the e changes constantly. 

### Hund's Rule of Max. Multiplicity
This rule is about filling of e in orbitals among the degenerate orbitals of a subshell. 

Pairing of electron among degenerate orbitals of a subshell occurs only when each orbital is filled up with one electron of similar spin. 
The last e can go into any of the orbitals. 

$$\underset{ p_{x} }{ \fbox{\uparrow \downarrow } } \underset{ p_{y} }{ \fbox{\uparrow  } } \underset{ p_{z} }{ \fbox{\uparrow  } }$$
$$\underset{ p_{x} }{ \fbox{\downarrow  } } \underset{ p_{y} }{ \fbox{\downarrow \uparrow} } \underset{ p_{z} }{ \fbox{\downarrow  } }$$

Total spin = $S = \frac{1}{2} \times n$, where n = no. of unpaired e
Multiplicity = $M = 2S+1$
