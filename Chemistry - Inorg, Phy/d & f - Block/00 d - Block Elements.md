# $d$-Block Elements
The d block elements of the periodic table contains the elements of the groups 3 - 12 in which the d orbitals are filled in each of the 4 long periods. 

The d block elements are called *transition elements.*

f-block elements are called *inner transition elements* and all f block elements belong to the 3rd group. 

Sc to Zn is called the 3d series.
Y to Cd is called the 4d series.
La to Hg is called the 5d series.

Ce to Lu is called the 4f series or *Lanthanide series.*
Th to Lr is called the 5f series or *Actinide series.*

**Outermost Shell:** $n^{th}$ shell 
**Penultimate Shell:** $(n-1)^{th}$ shell 
**Anti-Penultimate Shell:** $(n-2)^{th}$ shell 

#### Transition Elements
All are metals.

**Transition metals** are metals which have incompletely filled d orbital in the ground state or any common OS. Thus, Zn, Cd, Hg are not Transition elements. 
In fact, Zn, Cd, Hg are very much similar to properties as alkaline earth metals. They have less bp as compared to other elements and thus are called volatile metals.

The general outer e config is 
$$\ce{ (n-1)d^{1-10} ns^{1-2} }$$
Except Pd, $4d^{10}5s ^{0}$

Coinage metals are also from these due to their ductile and malleable nature, Cu, Ag, Au.

Noble metals are non reactive metals Cu, Ag, Au, Pt, Hg.

Cu is a transition element, as in a compound, it doesn't have $d^{10}$ configuration. 

The d orbitals of transition elements project to the periphery of atom more than s and p orbitals and hence are more influenced by other atoms/molecules (ligands).

### General Properties 
#### Magnetic Properties 
**Paramagnetic:**
- weakly attracted in magnetic field
- have one or more unpaired e
- non zero spin magnetic moment.

**Diamagnetic:**
- weakly repulsed in magnetic field
- have zero unpaired e
- zero spin magnetic moment.

**Ferromagnetic** metals are Fe, Co, Ni which are used to make permanent magnets.

Spin magnetic moment is,
$$\mu = \sqrt{ x(x+2) }$$
where x is no. of unpaired e. 

#### Formation of Coloured Ions 
Colour of d block metal compounds can be attributed mainly to d-d transition. 

In general, if there are no unpaired e, then the ion is colourless.

#### Formation of Complexes 
Due to small size, d block metals are good Lewis acids and hence accept lp from ligands to form complexes.

#### Catalytic Properties 
Transition metals and their compounds are will known for their catalytic attributes which are due to their ability to adopt variable OS, and form complexes.

#### Formation of Interstitial Compounds 
When small sized atoms (like H, C, S, N) are doped into metal crystals, these small atoms occupy interstices (or voids) of metal crystal forming interstitial compounds.

They are non stoichiometric and neither typically covalent of ionic. 

E.g. $\ce{ TiC, Mn_{4}N, Fe_{3}H, VH_{0.56} }$ etc.

Carbon steel is also an example of interstitial compounds where C atoms occupy voids in crystals of metallic iron.

Pure iron is soft and hence unusable for construction work.

##### General properties of IC
They have higher mp than that of pure metal.

They are very hard, some borides approach diamond in hardness.

They retain metallic conductivity. 

They are chemically inert. 

#### Alloy Formation 
Alloys are formed between metal atoms of similar size. Size difference should not exceed 15% as otherwise, the smaller atom will occupy voids.

**Brass:** Cu (60-80%) + Zn (40-20%)
**Bronze:** Cu (90%) + Sn (10%)
**Gun metal:** Cu (87%) + Sn (10%) + Zn (3%)
**German silver:** Cu (50%) + Zn (25%) + Ni (25%)
**Bell metal:** Cu (80%) + Sn (20%) 

**Stainless steel** is Fe + Cr + Ni. Their % compositions varies depending on desired properties. 
E.g. 18/8 Stainless Steel means 18% Cr, 8% Ni and the rest Fe.

**Duralumin:** Al + Mn + Cu. It is used in making body of aircraft. 
**Solder:** Pb + Sn
