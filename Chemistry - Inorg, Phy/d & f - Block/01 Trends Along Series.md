# Trends along the Series
#### Atomic  and Ionic Size
[[01 Atomic and Ionic size]]

First decreases then becomes almost similar in the middle and slightly increases at the end.

Reason: due to e-e repulsion. At the end the d subshell is fully filled.

##### Lanthanide Contraction 
[[01 Atomic and Ionic size#Lanthanoid Contraction]]

Atomic size of 5d elements after La are nearly the same as the 4d elements. This is due to the very poor shielding of f orbitals filled after La (Ce to Lu). 

#### MP, BP and Enthalpy of Vap.
MP, BP and $\Delta H_{vap}$ of d block elements are much higher than that of s and p block elements due to strong metallic bonding in d block.

First increases, reaches max. in the middle and then decreases.

Unpaired (n-1)d e and ns e take part in the metallic bond formation and hence greater no. of unpaired d e means greater bond strength and higher mp. 

Mn has lower mp because of stable configuration of Mn. The $3d^{5}$ e are not delocalised properly and hence strength of metallic bond is low.

(n-1)d unpaired e in 4d and 5d have greater tendency for get involved in interatomic bonding.

High enthalpy of vaporisation again due to the high strength of metallic bond.

#### Density 
Density increases as we move along the series. 
This is because,
1. Size decreases and thus atomic volume decreases
2. Molar mass increases 

And density is,
$$\delta = \frac{ \text{molar mass} }{ \text{molar volume} }$$

Density of Zn is lower than that of Cu due to the larger size of Zn atom.

Lowest density in d block is of Sc and highest is of Os and Ir.

#### Ionisation Enthalpy
In general IE increases from L to R in a series with irregular trends due to increase in $Z_{eff}$.

When one e is removed from ns orbital, relative energies of 3d and 4s change and the other e shifts to (n-1)d orbital.

2nd IE of Cr and Cu are irregularly high due to the fact that 2nd e are removed from $3d^{5}$ and $3d^{10}$.

#### Oxidation States
The most common OS of d block is +2. 
Some show fixed OS, 
Sc $\to +3$
Zn $\to +2$
Cd $\to +2$

Variety of OS increases from L to R, reaches max in the middle and then decreases towards the end.

It is due to no. of unpaired (n-1)d e which can be lost to form cation (lower OS) or share e to from covalent bond (higher OS).

(circled are common OS)

Unlike p block elements which show OS by a difference of 2, d block elements form compound in various OS differing by 1. This is due to the small difference in successive IEs.

Highest OS of d block are stabilised by O and F as they form strong bonds with d block metals.

O stabilises more than F because it forms strong double bonds.
$\ce{ Mn_{2}O_{7} }$ exists put $\ce{ MnF_{7} }$ does not.

Unlike p block, the stability of higher OS increases from T to B.

#### Standard Electrode Potentials 
There are no regular trends in SRP values.

Stability of a particular OS in solution depends on various factors like IE, $\Delta H_{sub}$, $\Delta H_{hyd}$ etc.

![[Pasted image 20240319161558.png]]

In general, the more -ve is the SRP, the greater is the stability of OS in aq. medium. 

![[Pasted image 20240319161831.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240319161852.png]]

In aq. solution, $\ce{ Co^{2+} }$ is more stable and $\ce{ Co^{3+} }$ is highly unstable. However, $\ce{ Co^{3+} }$ is highly stabile in complex compounds due to high CFSE released. 

$$\ce{ [Co(NH_{3})6]^{3+}, [Co(H_{2}O)6]^{3+}, [Co(C_{2}O_{4})3]^{3-} }$$

The SRP of $\ce{ Cu \to Cu^{2+} }$ is +ve and the max in the 3d series. This indicates that Cu has less tendency to convert into $\ce{ Cu^{2+} }$. It is attributed to high 2nd IE of Cu.

Extra stability of $\ce{ Mn^{2+} }$ is due to half filled stable config. 
$$\ce{ Mn: 3d^{5} 4s^{0} }$$

![[Pasted image 20240319162511.png]]

$\ce{ VF_{5} }$ is stable at room temp. put other pentahalides undergo hydrolysis to give oxohalides ($\ce{ VOX_{3} }$).

Another feature of halides is their instability in low OS. $\ce{ CuF, VF_{2} }$ do not exist. CuCl, CuBr, CuI do exist.

![[Pasted image 20240319163135.png]]

$\ce{ CuI_{2}, CuI_{3} }$ do not exist as $\ce{ I- }$ is a good RA. 

![[Pasted image 20240319163255.png]]

Many $\ce{ Cu+ }$ compounds undergo disproportionation in aq. solution. 
$$\ce{ 2Cu+ -> Cu_{(s)} + Cu^{2+}_{(aq)} }$$
$\ce{ Cu^{2+} }$ is more stable than $\ce{ Cu+ }$ because hydration enthalpy released of $\ce{ Cu^{2+} }$ is very high.
