# $f$-Block Elements
f Block consists of elements in which 4f and 5f orbitals are progressively filled.  

They are also called inner-transition elements. 

There are 14 Lanthanoids and 14 Actinoids. 
If there are unpaired e in f then they are coloured. 

The general outer e config is: $\ce{ (n-2)f^{1-10} (n-1)d^{0-1} ns^{2} }$

They show ever more variety of OS than even d block.

### Lanthanoids 
Lanthanoids start from Cerium (Ce) and end on Lutecium (Lu).

Only 3 out of the 14 elements have e in 5d orbital. Cerium (Ce), Gadolinium (Gd) and Lutetium (Lu).

#### Oxidation States 
Most common OS of Ln is +3. Ln$^{3+}$ have config $4f^{n}$ where n varies from 1 to 14. 

They may show +2 or +4 OS too. 

$\ce{ Ce^{4+} }$ is a powerful OA and is used in analytical chemistry. $\ce{ Ce^{4+} }$ has noble gas config (Xe type). 

$\ce{ Ce^{4+}|Ce^{3+}|Pt }$ has SRP 1.74 V. Thus it is a powerful OA. It can even oxidise water. But oxidation of water is a kinetically slow process so $\ce{ Ce(SO_{4})2 }$ is commonly used as OA.

$\ce{ Eu^{2+} }$ has $4f^{7}$ config yet it is a powerful RA as converts to $\ce{ Eu^{3+} }$.

#### Atomic and Ionic Size
Atomic size of 4f series elements decreases irregularly from La to Lu. It is due to poor shielding caused by f e. It is called Lanthanoid Contraction. 

**Exception:** Eu has largest atomic radius in entire 4f series. 

Ionic size $\ce{ Lu^{3+} }$ decreases regularly from La to Lu. 

#### General Characteristics 
All Lanthanoids are silvery white soft metals and tarnish (become dull) rapidly in air.

Sm (Samarium) is very hard and has highest mp in 4f series.

Many $\ce{ Ln^{3+} }$ both in the solid as aq. state are coloured due to unpaired e. 

$\ce{ \underset{ 4f^{0} }{ La^{3+} } and \underset{ 4f^{14} }{ Lu^{3+} } }$ do not show colour as they have no unpaired e.

1st and 2nd IE of Ln matches with Ca. Reactivity also matches with Ca for early Ln members. But as atomic no. increases they behave like Al.

#### Uses 
1. Lanthanoids are used for production of alloy steels for plates and pipes. 
2. **Mischmetall:** Ln(95%) + Fe (5%) + traces of C, S, Ca, Al 
   It is used in Mg based alloy to produce bullet shells and lighter flints. 
3. Mixed oxides of Lanthanoids are used as catalyst in petroleum cracking.

### Actinoids

#### Ionic Size 
$\ce{ M^{3+} }$ size regularly decreases across the 5f series, called **Actinoid Contraction.** It is more dominant than Lanthanoid contraction. 

4f orbitals in Ln are more buried due to poor shielding of one f e on another in 4f subshell.

#### Oxidation States 
They show a wider variety of OS than Ln. This is due to similar energies of 5f, 6f and 7s orbitals. 

Most common OS is +3 however they show +4, +5, +6 and +7 also.

#### General Characteristics 
All actinoids are silvery metals. 

They are highly active, particularly when powdered. 

With hot water, they form oxides and hydrides. 
$$\ce{ M + H_{2}O -> M(OH)3 + H_{2} ^ }$$
$$\ce{ M + H_{2} -> MH_{x} }$$

No effect of alkalines on them. 

They react with halogens. 

Reaction of $\ce{ HNO_{3} }$ is slow due to formation of protective oxide film on surface.

Most actinoids and their compounds are paramagnetic due to presence of unpaired e. 

Ionisation energy of early actinoids are lesser than that of early lanthanoids. 

5f e in actinoids are more effectively shielded from nuclear charge than 4f e in lanthanoids. Therefore, 5f e are less firmly held and hence available for bonding.

All actinoids are radioactive in nature.
