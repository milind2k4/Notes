# Silver Nitrate 
aka **Lunar Causic**
$$\ce{ AgNO_{3} }$$

##### Preparation 
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
Ag_{(s)} + dil. HNO_{3}_{(aq)} &-> AgNO_{3}_{(aq)} + NO ^ + H_{2}O 
 }
\end{split}
$$

##### Properties 
Colourless crystalline solid soluble in water.

It has powerful corrosive action (due to oxidising nature of $\ce{ AgNO_{3} }$) on organic tissues which turn black due to metallic Ag deposits on skin. Especially in the presence of sunlight. 

It is stored in coloured bottles. Because it decomposes in sunlight. 

$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
AgNO_{3}_{(s)} &->[\Delta] Ag_{(s)} + NO_{2} ^ + O_{2} ^ \\
Ag+ + Cl-/Br-/I-/SCN- &-> AgCl/AgBr/AgI/AgSCN v \\
\underset{ excess }{ AgNO_{3}_{(aq)} } + I_{2} &-> HNO_{3} + AgI v + AgIO_{3} v 
AgNO_{3}_{(aq)} + \underset{ excess }{I_{2} } &-> HNO_{3} + AgI v + HIO_{3}_{(aq)} 
 }
\end{split}
$$
Ammonical silver nitrate is Tollen's reagent and is used to identify reducing sugars and aldehydes. 

$$\ce{ RCHO + Ag+ + OH- -> RCOO- + Ag v + H_{2}O }$$

##### Uses 
1. As a lab reagent for testing $\ce{ Cl-, Br-, I-, SCN-, CN- etc. }$
2. Tollen's reagent 
3. In photography (to prepare AgBr and AgI) 
4. Used in making silver mirrors 
	$$\ce{ AgNO_{3} + HCNO -> Ag v + HCOO- + NO_{3}- }$$
	$\ce{ PB_{3}O_{4} }$ (read lead) is coated on top of mirror to avoid scratching of silver.

#### Photography 
It is based on decomposition of AgBr by light. 
$$\ce{ AgBr ->[h\nu] Ag_{(s)} + 1/2Br_{2} }$$

Celluloid tape is coated with emulsion of AgBr and glatin. 
AgF is not light sensitive. 

Sensitivity towards light,
$$\ce{ AgI > AgBr > AgCl }$$

In fast photography, AgI is used. In general, AgBr is more commonly used. 

##### Steps in Photography 
1. **Exposure** 
   $$\ce{ AgBr ->[h\nu] Ag_{(s)} + 1/2Br_{2} }$$
2. **Developing of film:** A mild RA hydroquinol is used

3. **Fixing the film (in dark room):** Sod. thiosulphate is used to remove unexposed AgBr. 
   $$\ce{ \underset{ unexposed }{ AgBr } + \underset{ hypo/fixer soln. }{ 2Na_{2}S_{2}O_{3}_{(aq)} } -> Na_{3}[Ag(S_{2}O_{3})2] + NaBr }$$
   Now film is light insensitive and is called Negative.
