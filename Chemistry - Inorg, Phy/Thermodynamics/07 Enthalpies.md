# Types of Heat of Reaction
#### Std. Enthalpy of Formation 
$$\Delta H_{f}^{o}$$

It is the enthalpy change when *1 mole* of a substance is formed from its *elements* in their standard state at given temp..

In general, the most stable state is the std. state.

**Std. state of elements at 25 C:**

$\Delta H_{f}^{o}$ of all elements in their std. state are assigned zero value.
And among ions, the $\Delta H_{f}^{o}$ for $\ce{ H+ }$ is assigned zero value.
$$\Delta H_{f}^{o}(\ce{ H+_{(aq)} }) = 0$$
conc. of $\ce{ H+ }$ is 1 M here.

##### Applications
of $\Delta H_{f}^{o}$

The more is $\Delta H_{f}^{o}$, the less is the thermodynamic stability. 

It can also be used to calculate $\Delta H_{r}$.
$$\Delta H_{r} = \sum (\Delta H_{f}^{o})_\text{products} - \sum (\Delta H_{f}^{o})_\text{reactants}$$

#### Enthalpy of Combustion 
$$\Delta H_{comb}$$
It is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of a fuel substance is burnt in excess of oxygen. 

Combustion is an exothermic process and thus $\Delta H_{comb}$ is always -ve. 

For solids, *1 mole atoms* are taken instead of 1 mole molecules.

##### Applications
of $\Delta H_{comb}$

To calculate heat of reaction,
$$\Delta H_{r} = \sum (\Delta H_{comb})_\text{reactants} - \sum (\Delta H_{comb})_\text{products}$$
Note that here, we have reactants - products instead of the other way around.

**Calorific Value (CV):** Calorific Value is enthalpy of combustion of fuel per molar mass of fuel.
$$C V = \frac{ \Delta H_{comb} }{ M }$$
Thus CV has unit kJ/g or kcal/g. 

Among the conventional fuel (fossil fuel) CV of $\ce{ H_{2} }$ is the highest. 
Among hydrocarbons, the more is the molar ratio $\ce{ H/C }$, the more is the CV.
$$\ce{ C_{2}H_{2} < C_{2}H_{4} < C_{2}H_{6} < H_{2} }$$

#### Enthalpy of Atomisation 
$$\Delta H_{atom}$$

It is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of a substance is dissociated or converted into its gaseous atoms. 

![[Pasted image 20240317210728.png]]

#### Lattice Enthalpy 
aka **Lattice Energy**
$$\Delta H_{LE}$$

It is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of ionic solid is converted into its constituent gaseous ions. 

This process is endothermic. 

![[Pasted image 20240317211003.png]]

#### Bond Enthalpy 
or Average Bond Enthalpy/Energy 
$$\Delta H_{BE}$$

It is average of the energy needed to break 1 mole of bond from given gaseous reactants to form gaseous atoms. 

![[Pasted image 20240317211609.png]]

##### Application of BE 
To calculate heat of reaction,
$$\Delta H_{r} = \sum (\Delta H_{BE})_\text{reactants} - \sum (\Delta H_{BE})_\text{products}$$
Here too, we subtract product from the reactant.

Note that all species should be in gaseous form.

In polymerisation, the terminal bonds are taken 1/2 per mole.

#### Enthalpy of Hydration 
$$\Delta H_{hyd}\ or\ \Delta H_{HE}$$

**For ions:** It is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of gaseous ions are dissolved in excess of water.  It is exothermic.

![[Pasted image 20240317214020.png]] 

**For ionic solids:** It is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of anhydrous or partially hydrated crystalline solid is mixed with required amount of water to form hydrated solid. It may be exo or endothermic.

#### Enthalpy of Solution
$$\Delta H_{sol}$$

It is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of substance is dissolved in excess of water to form solution.

#### Resonance Enthalpy 
[[05 Resonance]]
$$\Delta H_{RE}$$

It is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of the most stable resonating structure (or canonical structure) is converted into the resonance hybrid. 

It is exothermic because RH is more stable than any of the RS. 

Since RS are hypothetical, so $\Delta H_{RE}$ is determined using BE data or $\Delta H_{comb}$ or $\Delta H_{hyd}$.

![[Pasted image 20240317221350.png]]
($\Delta H'$ is known)

#### Enthalpy of Neutralisation 
$$\Delta H_{neut}$$

It is the enthalpy change when 1 g. eq. of an acid is neutralized with 1 g. eq. of a base to form salt and water. 

It is always exothermic.
Its unit is kJ/g.eq. or kcal/g.eq.

**For acid,** 1 g. eq. is the amount of acid which can produce a max. of 1 mole of $\ce{ H+ }$. Similarly for base.
e.g. 
1 g. eq. of $\ce{ HCl }$ is 1 mole.
1 g. eq. of $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$ is 1/2 mole.
1 g. eq. of $\ce{ Ba(OH)2 }$ is 1/2 mole.

When 1 mole $\ce{ H+ and OH- }$ combine, 13.7 kcal energy is released. 

**Neutralisation of SA and SB:**
Enthalpy of neutralisation of SA and SB is a constant value which is equal to -13.7 kcal/g.eq. or -57.3 kJ/g.eq. 

![[Pasted image 20240317221914.png]]

**Neutralisation of WA and SB:**
$$\Delta H_{neut} = -13.7 + \Delta H_{ion}(HA) \ce{ \ kcal/g.eq. }$$
Which is lesser than that of SA and SB. 

![[Pasted image 20240317222331.png]]

**Neutralisation of WA and WB:**
$$\Delta H_{neut} = -13.7 + \Delta H_{ion}(HA) + \Delta H_{ion}(BOH) \ce{ \ kcal/g.eq. }$$
Which is the least of the 3. 

Energy is used up in ionising the WA and/or WB and thus is less than the max. value -13.7.

#### Enthalpy of Transition 
$$\Delta H_{trans}$$

It is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of allotropic form of an element is converted into another allotropic form.
