# Thermochemistry
Branch of physics chemistry which deals with heat exchange in a chemical reaction. 

In Endothermic, $E_{R} < E_{P}$
In Exothermic, $E_{R} > E_{P}$

### Heat of Reaction
It is the heat liberated or absorbed when the molar quantities of reactants as indicated by stoichiometry have completely reacted to form products.

If energy is absorbed (endothermic), $\Delta H = +ve$
If energy is liberated (exothermic), $\Delta H = -ve$

**Standard Heat of Reaction ($\Delta H_{r}^{o}\ or\ \Delta U_{r}^{o}$)** are the values measured at P = 1 bar, C = 1 molar and with pure solid and/or liquid.

##### Factors Affecting Heat of Reaction
1. **At const. P or const. V.** 
	- Heat measured at constant pressure, (measured in constant pressure calorimeter)
	$$q_{p} = \Delta H_{r}$$
	- Heat measured at constant volume, (measured in constant volume calorimeter or Bomb Calorimeter)
	$$q_{v} = \Delta U_{r}$$
	
	The most commonly used calorimeter is Bomb calorimeter.
	
	Also,
	$$\Delta H_{r} = \Delta U_{r} + \Delta n_{g} RT$$

2. **Physical State or allotropic form,**
	- The more is the thermodynamic stability the less is the energy released.

1. **Effect of Temperature (Kirchhoff's Equation),**
	- Generally $\Delta H$ does not change with temp but if there is a significant change then,
	$$(\Delta C_{P})_{r} = \frac{ \Delta H_{2} - \Delta H_{1} }{ T_{2}-T_{1} }$$
	$$(\Delta C_{V})_{r} = \frac{ \Delta U_{2} - \Delta U_{1} }{ T_{2}-T_{1} }$$
	
	To find $(\Delta C_{P})_{r}$ of reaction,
	$$(\Delta C_{P})_{reac} = \sum (C_{P})_{P} - \sum (C_{P})_{R}$$

##### Bomb Calorimeter 
aka **Constant Volume Calorimeter**

It is an experimental device used to measure heat of reaction.

$$\Delta U = q_{v} = (m_\text{water} + WE) \times S \times \Delta T$$
where S is specific heat of water and WE is water equivalent of calorimeter.

WE is the amount of water which absorbs the same amount of heat as the components of the calorimeter like wall, thermometer, bomb etc.
