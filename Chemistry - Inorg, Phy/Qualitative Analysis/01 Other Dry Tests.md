# Other Dry Tests 
**Bunsen Flame:** The inner cone is reducing flame and luminous due to presence of C particles. The outer cone is oxidising flame and non luminous because it is in contact with $\ce{ O_{2} }$ from atmosphere.

#### Charcoal Cavity Test 
If coloured residue is obtained, the test is successful.

#### Cobalt Nitrate Test 
If residue in charcoal cavity test is white, then this test is performed. 

Few drops of cobalt nitrate (red) are added in white residue obtained in the charcoal cavity test and heated in *oxidising flame.* Residue of characteristic colour of mixed oxides are obtained.

MgO . CoO &: Pink \\
SnO . CoO &: Bluis Green 
 }
\end{split}
$$

We never use excess of cobalt nitrate, otherwise black residue will be obtained due to $\ce{ Co_{2}O_{3} }$.

#### Flame Test 
Used mainly for alkali and alkaline earth metals and copper salts. 

Given salt is converted into metal chloride (volatile) before performing the test. 

Pt wire is dipped in the solution so that metal chloride sticks to it and then it is heated in *oxidising flame.*

The characteristic colour of flame is observed due to deexcitation of e in metal atoms.

\end{split}
$$

Be and Mg do not respond to flame test i.e. they have no characteristic colour.

#### Borax Bead Test 
[[09 Various Hybridisations#Borax]]

Borax: $\ce{ Na_{2}B_{4}O_{7}.10H_{2}O }$

It is mainly used for d block metals. 

A Pt wire is coiled and heated and then dipped into borax. On heating, it swells and on cooling, it shrinks into a transparent glassy bead over the Pt wire ($\ce{ NaBO_{2} + B_{2}O_{3} }$).

Now this bead wrapped on Pt coil is dipped into given salt and again heated in *oxidising flame* and the characteristic colour is recorded. Now the same is heated in *reducing flame* and colour is recorded. 

Different colours are due to formation of metal meta borated in different oxidation states.

#### Microcosmic Bead Test
[[01 Classification of Salts#Mixed Salt]]

aka Phosphate bead test.

The same thing as borax bead test.
