# Qualitative Analysis
aka **Salt Analysis**

Salt consists of two ions, cation *(acid radical)* and anion *(basic radical)*

Salt Analysis is the systematic procedure of detecting cation and anion in the given salt sample.

Following four steps are followed to detect cation and anion in given sample of salt:
1. *Physical Appearance Test:* Colour, Smell, Weight, Texture, etc.
2. *Dry Heating Test:* Smell of fumes.
3. *Other Dry Test*
4. *Wet Tests (or confirmatory test):* Additions of reagent in solution phase.

#### Physical Appearance test 
They are not decisive tests. They are mainly used to narrow down the possibilities.

**Salt is Colourless:** Alkali or Alkaline earth metals.
$$\ce{ Na+, K+, Zn+, Al+, Cd^{2+}, Ba^{2+}, Ca^{2+} etc. }$$

**Salt is Coloured:** Transition metals
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
blue &: Cu^{2+} \\
green &: Ni^{2+} \\
light green &: Fe^{2+} \\
reddish brown &: Fe^{3+} \\
pink red &: Co^{2+} \\
light pink (flesh coloured) &: Mn^{2+} 
 }
\end{split}
$$

**Smell of Salt:**
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
Amonical &: NH_{4}+ \\
Vinegar &: CH_{3}COO- \\
Rotten Egg &: S^{2-}
 }
\end{split}
$$

**Density:**
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
heavy &: Pb^{2+}, Ba^{2+} \\
light fluffy powder &: CO_{3}^{2-}
 }
\end{split}
$$

**Deliquescence:** It refers to property of salt to absorb atmospheric moisture and become paste like. $\ce{ MgCl_{2} }$ is a deliquescent salt.
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
Colourless &: Mg^{2+}, Al^{3+}, Zn^{2+} \\
Coloured &: Cu^{2+}, Fe^{3+}
 }
\end{split}
$$
Table salt becomes wet in rainy season due to presence of small amounts of $\ce{ MgCl_{2} }$ as NaCl is not deliquescent.

#### Dry Heating test 
A dry test tube free from moisture is taken.

On heating, if the salt is not volatile, a gas is evolved.

**Gas Evolved:**
- Colourless and Odourless Gas: 

	$$
	\begin{split}
	\ce{ 
	CO_{2} &: CO_{3}^{2-}, HCO_{3}- \\
	O_{2} &: ClO_{3}-, BrO_{3}-, IO_{3}- etc. \\
	}
	\end{split}
	$$

- Colourless gas with Odour: 

	$$
	\begin{split}
	\ce{ 
	Rotten Egg (H_{2}S) &: S^{2-} \\
	Vinegar (CH_{2}COOH) &: CH_{3}COO- \\
	Sulphur burning (suffocating) (SO_{2}) &: SO_{3}^{2-}, S_{2}O_{3}^{2-} \\
	Ammonical (NH_{3}) &: NH_{4}- \\
	Pungent (HCl) &: Cl- \\
	 }
	\end{split}
	$$

- Coloured gas with Odour:  #important 
	$$
	\begin{split}
	\ce{ 
	Reddish Brown &: NO_{2}-, Br- \\
	Violet Black &: I- \\
	Yelloish Green &: Cl-
	 }
	\end{split}
	$$

**Formation of Sublimate:** Due to temp. difference between the upper and lower test tube, some solid is deposited on the inner walls. This is called Sublimate.

$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
White &: NH_{4}Cl, Hg_{2}Cl_{2}, HgCl_{2} \\
Yellow &: S, Ag_{2}S_{3}, Hg_{2}I_{2}, HgI_{2} \\
Black &: Hg_{2}S, HgS
 }
\end{split}
$$

**Decrepitation:** Crackling sound on heating sound. 
Generally it is found in salts having no water of crystallisation. 
Examples are $\ce{ Pb(NO_{3})2, Ba(NO_{3})2, KCl, NaCl }$

**Swelling:** $\ce{ PO_{4}^{3-}, BO_{3}- }$ salts on heating convert into large voluminous mass. It is observed in Borax Bead test and Phosphate Bead test. 

**Colour of Residue:** 
- Yellow when hot and white when cold: $\ce{ ZnO }$ 
- Brown when hot and yellow when cold: $\ce{ PbO }$ 
- $\ce{ CuSO_{4}.5H_{2}O }$ is blue, but on heating it turns white ($\ce{ CuSO_{4} }$).

### Dil. Sulphuric Acid Group 
#### Carbonate and Bicarbonate 
On adding reagent dil. $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$, colourless, odourless gas evolves with brisk effervescence. 
$$\ce{ CO_{3}^{2-}, HCO_{3}- + H+ -> CO_{2} ^ + H_{2}O }$$

When evolved gas is passed through lime water or baryta ($\ce{ Ba(OH)2 }$) water, it becomes turbid (or milky).
$$\ce{ Ca(OH)2 + CO_{2} -> \underset{ white }{ CaCO_{3} } v + H_{2}O }$$

When gas is passes for prolonged period, milkyness dissappears.
$$\ce{ CaCO_{3} + CO_{2} + H_{2}O -> Ca(HCO_{3})2 }$$

$\ce{ SO_{2} }$ also gives similar test. 
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
Ca(OH)2 + SO_{2} &-> \underset{ white }{ CaSO_{3} } v + H_{2}O  \\
CaCO_{3} + SO_{2} + H_{2}O &-> Ca(HSO_{3})2
 }
\end{split}
$$

To differentiate between $\ce{ CO_{2} }$ and $\ce{ SO_{2} }$, a filter paper dipped in acidified $\ce{ K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7} }$ is brought near the gas. It turns green if the gas is $\ce{ SO_{2} }$ and $\ce{ CO_{2} }$ does not react with it.

$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
Cr_{2}O_{7}^{2-} + H+ + SO_{2} &->  SO_{4}^{2-} + Cr ^{3+} \\
Cr_{2}O_{7}^{2-} + H+ + CO_{2} &->  No Rreaction 
}
\end{split}
$$

To distinguish between carbonate and bicarbonate, we use phenolphthalein test.
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
CO_{3}^{2-} &->[HPh] Pink \\
HCO_{3}^{-} &->[HPh] Colourless 
}
\end{split}
$$

On adding $\ce{ BaCl_{2} }$ or $\ce{ MgSO_{4} }$,
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
Ba^{2+} + CO_{3}^{2-} &-> \underset{ white }{ BaCO_{3} } v \\
Ba^{2+} + HCO_{3}- &-> Ba(HCO_{3})_{(aq)} ->[\Delta] BaCO_{3} v 
 }
\end{split}
$$

On adding silver nitrate,
$$\ce{ Ag+ + CO_{3}^{2-} -> \underset{ white }{ Ag_{2}CO_{3} } v ->[\Delta] \underset{ yellow brown }{ Ag_{2}O } + CO_{2} ^ }$$
