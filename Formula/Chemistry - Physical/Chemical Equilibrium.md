# Chemical Equilibrium
At equilibrium,
$$
\begin{split}
R_{f} &= R_{b} \\
\Delta G_{r} &= 0 \\
\Delta G^{o}_{r} &= -RT\ln k_{eq}
\end{split}
$$

Relative Humidity,
$$\ce{ RH = \frac{ p_{H_{2}O(vap)} }{ VP of H_{2}O_{(l)} } \times 100 }$$

Law of mass action,
$$R = k[A]^{a}[B]^{b}\dots$$

Relation between concentration and partial pressure,
$$p_{A} = [A]RT$$

Equilibrium constant,
$$k_{eq} = \frac{ k_{f} }{ k_{b} } = \frac{ [C]^{c} \cdot [D]^{d} }{ [A]^{a} \cdot [B]^{b} }$$
- If reaction is reversed, k becomes reciprocal. 
- If a factor is multiplied, k is raised to that factor.
- If two reactions are added, their ks are multiplied.

Relation between $k_{c}$ and $k_{p}$,
$$k_{p} = k_{c}(RT)^{\Delta n_{g}}$$
where $\Delta n_{g}$ is P - R.

Arrhenius equation,
$$k = Ae^{ -E_{a}/RT }$$
- For exothermic, $T \uparrow \implies k \downarrow$
- For endothermic, $T \uparrow \implies k \uparrow$

**Van't Hoff Equation,**
Integral form,
$$\ln \frac{ k_{1} }{ k_{2} } = \frac{ \Delta H }{ R }\left( \frac{ 1 }{ T_{1} } - \frac{ 1 }{ T_{2} } \right)$$
Differential form,
$$d(\ln k) = \frac{ \Delta H }{ RT^{2} }dT$$

Degree of dissociation,
$$\alpha = \frac{ x }{ a } = \frac{ \text{how many broken} }{ \text{how many taken} }$$
