# Capacitance 
Capacitance of isolated metal,
$$C = \frac{ Q }{ V }$$

Capacitance of isolated metal sphere,
$$C = 4\pi e_{o}R$$

Energy stored in capacitor/conductor,
$$U = \frac{ 1 }{ 2 }CV^{2} = \frac{ Q^{2} }{ 2C } = \frac{ 1 }{ 2 }QV$$

**Parallel Plate Capacitor,**
$$C = \frac{ A\varepsilon_{o} }{ d }$$

#### Sharing of Charge 
Common potential,
$$V = \frac{ C_{1}V_{1} + C_{2}V_{2} }{ C_{1} + C_{2} }$$

Charge on each capacitor,
$$
\begin{split}
Q_{1} &= \frac{ C_{1} }{ C_{1} + C_{2} }(C_{1}V_{1} + C_{2}V_{2})
Q_{2} &= \frac{ C_{2} }{ C_{1} + C_{2} }(C_{1}V_{1} + C_{2}V_{2})
\end{split}
$$

#### Circuit with Capacitor 
If capacitor is uncharged, at t = 0, it behaves like a short wire.
At $t \to \infty$, capacitor behaves like a broken wire.

Current through resistor,
$$i = \frac{ \varepsilon - q /C }{ R }$$

Charge across capacitor,
$$Q=  C\varepsilon$$

Work done by battery,
$$W = \varepsilon Q = C\varepsilon^{2}$$

Change in potential energy stored in capacitor,
$$\Delta U = \frac{ 1 }{ 2 }C\varepsilon^{2}$$

Heat loss,
$$hl = \frac{ 1 }{ 2 }C\varepsilon^{2}$$

#### Combination of Capacitors 
Series combination,
$$\frac{ 1 }{ C_{eq} } = \frac{ 1 }{ C_{1} } + \frac{ 1 }{ C_{2} }$$

Parallel Combination,
$$C_{eq} = C_{1} + C_{2}$$
