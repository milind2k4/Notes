# Buoyancy Force or Upthrust Force
If a solid is submerged in water, it will have more force on its bottom than its top due to the pressure difference. 

Due to this difference, there will be a net contact force upwards on the solid. This force is called Buoyancy force or Upthrust force.

Consider a solid cylinder of density $\sigma$ height H and cross sectional area A. 

In the horizontal direction, the forces will cancel out.

In vertical direction, we can write, net force by liquid,
$$
\begin{split}
f_{net} &= (P + \rho gH)A - PA \\
&= \rho gHA \\
&= \rho g V \\
&= f_{b}
\end{split}
$$

Thus, we get,
$$f_{b} = \rho_{l} V_{s} g$$

We can also write, force due to gravity,
$$mg = \sigma V_{s}g$$

Thus, if $\sigma > \rho$ the cylinder will sink. 
And, if $\sigma < \rho$ the cylinder will float.

#### Archimedes' Principle 
Whenever a solid is submerged in a liquid, then due to pressure difference, the liquid will apply an upward contact force, called *Buoyancy force* on the solid which will be equal to the weight of the liquid displaced. 

$$f_{b} = m_{l}g = \rho Vg$$

If specific gravity (sg) and mass of solid is given, and the liquid is water,
$$
\begin{split}
f_{b} &= \rho V g \\
&= \rho \frac{ m }{ \sigma } g \\
&= \frac{ mg }{ \sigma/\rho } \\
&= \frac{ mg }{ sg }
\end{split}
$$

#### Apparent Weight 
[[00 Circular Motion#Effect of Earth's Rotation on g]]

If we submerge a solid in a liquid, it will have lower weight than mg due to the buoyant force by the liquid. 

$$
\begin{split}
T + f_{b} &= mg \\
T &= mg - f_{b} \\
&= mg - \frac{ mg\rho }{ \sigma } \\
&= mg \left( 1 - \frac{ \rho }{ \sigma } \right)
\end{split}
$$

#### Floatation 
The object will only float if $\sigma < \rho$. 

Since the object is floating,
$$
\begin{split}
mg &= f_{b} \\
\sigma Vg &= \rho V_{in}g \\
\frac{ V_{in} }{ V } &= \frac{ \sigma }{ \rho }
\end{split}
$$

#### Centre of Buoyancy 
Similar to [[05 ME, force Couple and POAF#Point of Application of Force (POAF)|POAF]] in RBD.

It is the point at which we can consider the buoyancy force to be acting. 

In general, it is at the geometrical centre of submerged part.
