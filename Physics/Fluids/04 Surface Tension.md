# Surface Tension 
Due to surface tension, surface of a liquid behaves like a membrane. 

#### Force of Surface Tension
If a rod is placed on a liquid, it will experience a force due to molecules of the liquid. 

This force is,
$$f \propto l$$

And thus, 
$$f = Sl$$
This constant S depends on liquid and is called *coefficient of surface tension.* It has unit F/m.

This force is always perpendicular to the length.

Water has S,
$$S_{w} = 0.075 \ce{\ N/m }$$
And soap has S,
$$S_{s} = 0.03 \ce{\ N/m }$$

Thus we use soapy water to wash clothes, as it decreases the surface tension of water, and thus allows it to go in between the fibres of the cloth.

### Surface Energy
![[Pasted image 20240214220014.png]]

There is a frame with one arm moveable and it has a thin film of soap solution on it.

We extend the arm by x and the surface area of the film increases. 

Now, work done by ST,
$$W = -2Slx$$

We get,
$$
\begin{split}
\Delta U &= -W_{c} \\
\Delta U &= 2Slx \\
\Delta U &= S\Delta A
\end{split}
$$

Thus finally,
$$U = SA$$

This energy is stored in the film and is called *Surface Energy.*

### Excess Pressure or Gauge Pressure 
Due to atmospheric pressure and surface tension, a droplet will try to become smaller.

This is also supported by the fact that as the area decreases, the surface energy also decreases and thus the system becomes more stable. 

Due to this tendency, the pressure inside will be more than $P_{atm}$. This extra pressure is called Gauge Pressure. 

To find this pressure, first we imagine the drop to be cut in between. 

The hemisphere is in equilibrium and thus we can write,
$$
\begin{split}
P_{atm}\pi R^{2} + S_{2}\pi R &= (P_{atm} + \Delta P)\pi R^{2} \\
\Delta P &= \frac{ 2S }{ R }
\end{split}
$$

This excess pressure is towards the centre of the surface.

#### Soap Bubble
(hollow bubble)

Outside the bubble, the pressure will be,
$$P_{A} = P_{atm}$$

In the interface (soap part) the pressure will be,
$$P_{B} = P_{A} + \frac{ 2S }{ R_{2} }$$

Inside the bubble, the pressure will be,
$$P_{C} = P_{B} + \frac{ 2S }{ R_{1} }$$

Thus, inside the bubble, the pressure is,
$$P_{C} = P_{atm} + \frac{ 2S }{ R_{1} } + \frac{ 2S }{ R_{2} }$$

And the excess pressure is,
$$\Delta P = \frac{ 2S }{ R_{1} } + \frac{ 2S }{ R_{2} }$$

If the soap bubble is very very thin, the radii are the same and thus,
$$\Delta P = \frac{ 4S }{ R }$$
