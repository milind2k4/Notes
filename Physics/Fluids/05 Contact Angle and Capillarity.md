# Contact Angle and Capillarity 
## Contact Angle 
When a liquid surface comes in contact with a solid, it can either climb up it, or avoid it.

The angle made by the tangent drawn at the contact between them with the side of the solid through the liquid is called Contact Angle.

If the contact angle is acute, the liquid wets the solid. 
If it is obtuse, the liquid does not wet the solid.

Contact angle depends on intermolecular forces. 

Intermolecular forces between liquid - liquid is called **Cohesive.**
Intermolecular forces between solid - liquid is called **Adhesive.**

If the adhesive force is more than the horizontal component cohesive force, the contact angle will be acute.

If the adhesive force is less than the horizontal component  cohesive force, the contact angle will be obtuse.

If the adhesive force is equal to the horizontal component  cohesive force, the contact angle will be right.

## Capillarity 
Capillary tube is a cylindrical tube with small radius and is open from both ends. 

If we put this tube into a liquid, the liquid rises along the inner surface of the tube. This is known as Capillarity. 

The top surface of the liquid in the tube is called **Meniscus.**

The contact angle between liquid and the tube is $\theta$.
And the liquid rises to height h in the tube.

Due to surface tension, the glass will pull the liquid upwards.

At equilibrium, for water in the tube, we can write,
$$
\begin{split}
2\pi r S\cos \theta &= \rho \pi r^{2} h g \\
h &= \frac{ 2S\cos \theta }{ r \rho g }
\end{split}
$$

Here, 
$$h \propto \frac{ 1 }{ r }$$
Thus, the water will rise higher, the smaller the radius is.

If $\theta$ is acute, h will be +ve, i.e. rise. 
If $\theta$ is obtuse, h will be -ve, i.e. dip.

Now, if the radius of curvature of the meniscus is R, we can write, 
$$\cos \theta = \frac{ r }{ R }$$

Thus, we can write, pressure at point just below meniscus,
$$P = P_{atm} - \frac{ 2S }{ R }$$

Pressure at h distance below this point,
$$
\begin{split}
P_{atm} - \frac{ 2S }{ R } + \rho gh &= P_{atm} \\
h &= \frac{ 2S }{ \rho gR } \\
&= \frac{ 2S \cos \theta }{ \rho gr }
\end{split}
$$

If the capillary tube is of insufficient length, the water will not overflow, but the contact angle will increase to the point where height is the same as that of tube.
