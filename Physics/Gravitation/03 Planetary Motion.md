# Planetary Motion
### Kepler's Laws
##### Law of Path 
A planet will move in an [[02 Ellipse|elliptical]] path with the sun at one of its foci. 

When the planet is closest to the sun, that position is called the **perihelion.** And when it is the farthest, it is called **aphelion.**

The min. distance is $a(1-e)$ and the max. is $a(1+e)$.

##### Law of Areal Velocity 
Areal velocity is defined as,
$$\text{areal velocity} = \frac{ dA }{ dt }$$

This areal velocity is,
$$\frac{ dA }{ dt } = \frac{ L }{ 2m }$$
where L is the angular momentum of planet about sun and m is its mass. 

Since the gravitational force on the planet passes through sun, about sun there is no torque on the planet. Thus the angular momentum remains constant. 

Thus, the areal velocity of a planet is constant. 

*A planet will sweep equal area in an equal amount of time.*

As a consequence of this, when the planet is close to the sun, it moves faster and when it is further away, it moves slower.

From this law, we can find the time period of a planet,

##### Law of Time Period 
For circular motion,
$$
\begin{split}
\frac{ GMm }{ r^{2} } &= \frac{ mv^{2} }{ r } \\
v &= \sqrt{ \frac{ GM }{ r } } \\
\omega &= \sqrt{ \frac{ GM }{ r^{3} } } 
\end{split}
$$
This gives, time period,
$$
\begin{split}
T &= 2\pi \sqrt{ \frac{ r^{3} }{ GM } }
T^{2} &= 4\pi^{2} \frac{ r^{3} }{ GM } 
\end{split}
$$

Thus,
$$T^{2} \propto r^{3}$$

For elliptical orbit also, the same concept applies, and we get,
$$T = 2\pi \sqrt{ \frac{ a^{3} }{ GM } }$$
And we get,
$$T^{2} \propto a^{3}$$
