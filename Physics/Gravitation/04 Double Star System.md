# Double Star System
Or any number of stars. 

If two celestial bodies have comparable mass. 

The force between them is,
$$f = \frac{ Gm_{1}m_{2} }{ r^{2} }$$

Since they have comparable masses, they will move about their centre of mass,
$$
\begin{split}
r_{1} &= \frac{ m_{2}r }{ m_{1} + m_{2} } \\
r_{2} &= \frac{ m_{1}r }{ m_{1} + m_{2} } 
\end{split}
$$

Angular Velocity of both will be the same. 

Since all three, $m_{1}, \ce{ COM }, m_{2}$ must be one the same line, if $m_{1}$ travels $\theta$, $m_{2}$ must also travel $\theta$. Thus they both will have same $\omega$.

Using newton's laws,
$$
\begin{split}
G\frac{ m_{1}m_{2} }{ r^{2} } &= m_{1}\omega^{2} r_{1} \\
G\frac{ m_{2} }{ r^{2} } &= \omega^{2} \frac{ m_{2}r }{ m_{1} + m_{2} }
\end{split}
$$

Thus giving,
$$\omega = \sqrt{ \frac{ G(m_{1} + m_{2}) }{ r^{3} } }$$
