# Units and Dimensions
#### Physical Quantities
Quantities which can be measured by an instrument and by means of which we can describe the laws of physics. 

Three types,

### Fundamental
Which are elementary and cover the entirety of physics. 

- Length (L)
- Time (T)
- Mass (M)
- Temperature (K)
- Electrical Current (A)
- Luminous Intensity (Cd)
- Amount of Substance (mol)

### Derived
Which can be expressed in terms of fundamental quantities.

Velocity: $[LT^{-1}]$


### Supplementary
Besides 7 fundamental quantities there are 2 other quantities called Supplementary Quantities.

- Plane Angle: $\theta = \displaystyle \frac{Arc}{r}$, unit radian, dimensionless.

- Solid Angle: $\Omega = \displaystyle \frac{Area}{r^{2}}$ unit steradian, dimensionless. 

### Some Common Physical Quantities & Constants:

Velocity: $[LT^{-1}]$

Acceleration: $[LT^{-2}]$

Force: $[MLT^{-2}]$

Energy: $[ML^{2}T^{-2}]$

Plank Constant $h$: $\displaystyle \frac{ E }{ \nu } = [ML^{2}T^{-1}]$

Coefficient of Viscosity $\eta$ : $F = 6\pi \eta rv \implies \displaystyle \frac{ F }{ rv } = [ML^{-1}T^{-1}]$

Young's Modulus $y$: $y = \displaystyle \frac{stress}{strain} = \frac{ F(l) }{ A(\Delta l) }=  \frac{ F }{ A }= [ML^{-1}T^{-2}]$


## Rules of Units and Dimensions:
1. Any quantity can only be added to or subtracted from the same type of quantity. 
1. The argument and the result of all trigonometric functions, log, exponents are both dimensionless.   

### Uses of Dimensional Analysis:
- Dimensional analysis is used to check partial correctness of formula. 

- It can also be used to partially derive a formula. 

- We can use it to express any quantity in terms of any other quantities.

- Find change in numerical value on changing unit

Also,
$$\text{Numerical Value } \propto \frac{1}{\text{Unit}}$$

$$n u = Constant$$
i.e.
$$n_{1}u_{1} = n_{2}u_{2}$$
where,
$n \to$ numerical value
$u \to$ unit
