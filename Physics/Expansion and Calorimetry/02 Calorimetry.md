# Calorimetry 
It is the study of heat in liquids and solids. 

We do not consider the change in volume of solids and liquids in calorimetry. 

Here, the heat provided, in addition to changing temp., can also change the phase of the substance. 

**Calorie:** 1 cal is the amount of heat required at 1 atm pressure to increase temp. of 1 gram water from 14.5 C to 15.5 C.
$$\ce{ 4.2 J = 1 cal }$$

#### Specific Heat (S)
It is heat provided per unit mass and temp. change.

$$S = \frac{ \Delta Q }{ m\Delta T }$$
Thus we can write,
$$\Delta Q = mS\Delta T$$

It is property of object and has unit J/kg-K. 

For water, 
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
S_{w} &= 1 cal/g K \\
&= \frac{ 1 kcal }{ kg K }
&= \frac{ 4.2 J }{ g K } \\
&= \frac{ 4200 J }{ kg K } \\
 }
\end{split}
$$

For steam and ice,
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
S_{ice} &= S_{steam} \\
&= \frac{ 0.5 cal }{ g K } \\
&= \frac{ 500 cal }{ kg K } \\
&= \frac{ 2.1 J }{ g K } \\
&= \frac{ 2100 J }{ kg K } \\
 }
\end{split}
$$

#### Latent Heats (L)
Latent heat does not change temp., but phase.

##### L of Fusion
When we provide heat to a solid or take heat away from a liquid, it changes phase and becomes a liquid and solid respectively. 

During phase change, the temp. does not change. 

This heat provided per unit mass is called Latent Heat. 

$$L_{f} = \frac{ \Delta Q }{ m }$$

Its unit is J/K. 

For $\ce{ ice <-> water }$, 
$$L_{f} = 80 \ce{ \frac{ cal }{ g } }$$

##### L of Vaporisation 
The same has $L_{f}$, but for $\ce{ liquid <-> gas }$.

$$L_{v} = \frac{ \Delta Q }{ m }$$

For $\ce{ water <-> steam }$,
$$L_{v} = 540 \ce{ \frac{ cal }{ g } }$$

#### Heat Capacity (C)
It is defined as heat provided per unit temp. change.

$$C = \frac{ \Delta Q }{ \Delta T } = mS$$

C has unit J/K. 

### Law of Calorimetry 
aka **Law of Mixture**

Calorimeter is a device in which we mix liquids. It is considered to be isolated from the surroundings.

*Heat lost by one liquid is the same as the heat gained by another.*

In other words, we can say that the algebraic sum of heat lost by all  the liquids is zero.
$$\sum Q_{out} = 0$$

Using this, for two liquids, we get,
$$T = \frac{ C_{1}T_{1} + C_{2}T_{2} }{ C_{1} + C_{2} }$$

#### Water Equivalent 
The amount of water required to consume the same amount of heat as a substance consumes for the same rise in the temperature.

$$
\begin{split}
\Delta Q &= mS\Delta T \\
mS\Delta T &= m_{w}S_{w} \Delta T \\
m_{w} &= \frac{ mS }{ S_{w} }
\end{split}
$$

If water equivalent of calorimeter is given, then we consider calorimeter to be consuming heat as well.

### Temp. vs Heat Given 
As we provide heat, the temp. of the solid increases. After one point, the solid reaches melting point and the temp. stops increasing. 

After the whole solid is melted, i.e. we have provides $mL_{f}$ amount of heat, then then temp. of the liquid formed will increase. 

Again, some time later, the liquid reaches boiling point and the temp. stops increasing until all the liquid has become gas, i.e. we have provided $mL_{v}$ amount of heat. 

Then the temp. increases again linearly according to $\Delta Q = mS_{v}\Delta T$. 

The slopes of the linear increases will be in the ratio,
$$\tan \theta_{1} : \tan \theta_{2} : \tan \theta_{3} :: \frac{ 1 }{ S_{s} } : \frac{ 1 }{ S_{l} } : \frac{ 1 }{ S_{g} }$$
