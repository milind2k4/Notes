# Head on Collision 

![[Pasted image 20230706133940.png]]

Momentum Conservation,
$$m_{1}u_{1} + m_{2}u_{2} = m_{1}v_{1} + m_{2}v_{2}$$

$$e = \frac{ v_{2} - v_{1} }{ u_{1} - u_{2} }$$
$$v_{2} = v_{1} + e(u_{1} - u_{2})$$

$$m_{1}u_{1} + m_{2}u_{2} = m_{1}v_{1} + m_{2}(v_{1} + e(u_{1}-u_{2}))$$

Giving,
$$v_{1} = \frac{ m_{1}u_{1} + m_{2}u_{2} - m_{2}e(u_{1}-u_{2}) }{ m_{1} + m_{2} }$$

And,
$$v_{2} = \frac{ m_{1}u_{1} + m_{2}u_{2} - m_{1}e(u_{1}-u_{2}) }{ m_{1} + m_{2} }$$
but these formulas are not to be remembered. 

### Same Mass Elastic Collision 
Here $m_{1} = m_{2} = m$ and e = 1.

Thus we get,
$$v_{1} = \frac{ m(u_{1} + u_{2}) - m(u_{1} - u_{2}) }{ 2m }$$

That is,
$$v_{1} = u_{2}$$

Similarly,
$$v_{2} = u_{1}$$

Thus, **in head on elastic collision, velocities are interchanged.**

### Head on Perfectly Inelastic Collision 
Here e = 0.

The bodies will stick together and they will have the same velocity. 

$$v_{com} = \frac{ m_{1}u_{1} + m_{2}u_{2} }{ m_{1} + m_{2} }$$

### Collision with Massive Body
$$m_{2} \gg m_{1}$$

Velocity of the smaller body,
$$
\begin{split}
v_{1} &= \frac{ m_{1}u_{1} + m_{2}u_{2} - m_{2}e(u_{1}-u_{2}) }{ m_{1} + m_{2} }\\
\\
v_{1} &= \frac{ m_{1}u_{1} + m_{2}u_{2} - m_{2}e(u_{1}-u_{2}) }{ m_{2} }\\
\\
v_{1} &= \frac{ m_{1} }{ m_{2} }u_{1} + u_{2} - e(u_{1} - u_{2}) \\
\\
&= u_{2} - e(u_{1} - u_{2})
\end{split}
$$

Again, velocity of the large body,
$$
\begin{split}
v_{1} &= \frac{ m_{1}u_{1} + m_{2}u_{2} - m_{2}e(u_{1}-u_{2}) }{ m_{2} }\\ 
\\
v_{1} &= \frac{ m_{1} }{ m_{2} }u_{1} + u_{2} + \frac{ m_{1} }{ m_{2} }e(u_{1}- u_{2}) \\
&= u_{2}
\end{split}
$$

Thus, the velocity of the big object is unchanged,
$$v_{2} = u_{2}$$
Thus the velocity of smaller body can be written as,
$$
\begin{split}
v_{1} &=  v_{2} - e(u_{1} - u_{2}) \\
v_{2} - v_{1} &=  e(u_{1} - u_{2}) \\
e &=  \frac{ v_{2} - v_{1} }{ u_{1} - u_{2} }
\end{split}
$$
Thus the velocity of the smaller body can be found by the equation of e.

The velocity of the large body is decreased very slightly. When this decrease is multiplied by the large mass, in the expression for KE, the difference is large and thus the KE of the large body is also decreased. Thus the KE of the system will decrease even if the velocity of the small object increases.
