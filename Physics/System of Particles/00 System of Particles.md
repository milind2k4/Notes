## Linear Momentum Conservation Theorem
aka Momentum Conservation Theorem 

[[02 Motion of COM]]

If on system, $\vec{f}_{ext} = 0$, then $\vec{a}_{com}= 0$ this gives, $\vec{v}_{com} = \text{constant}$ and thus $\vec{P}_{sys} = M\vec{v}_{com} = \text{constant}$. Hence, the initial and final momentum are the same,
$$\vec{P}_{i} = \vec{P}_{f}$$

*If External force on a system is zero then linear momentum of system will remain constant or conserved.* 

We can also break this into components,
- if $(f_{ext})_{x} = 0$, then,
	$$P_{ix} = P_{ix} = 0$$
- if $(f_{ext})_{y} = 0$, then,
	$$P_{iy} = P_{iy} = 0$$
- if $(f_{ext})_{z} = 0$, then,
	$$P_{iz} = P_{iz} = 0$$

In whichever direction the external force is zero, we can conserve linear momentum.

Momentum Conservation is often used with [[03 Energy#Total Mechanical Energy Conservation Theorem]]

#### COM is fixed

If COM is fixed, $u_{com} = 0, a_{com} = 0, f_{ext} = 0, \vec{P}_{sys} = 0$.
That is, internal forces have no effect on the COM. 

Here we use result, [[01.1 Discrete particles#Displacement of one of the Particles]]

We can also apply this to more than two objects, we just consider every object moving in the same direction on one side of the equals.

#### When $K_{i} = K_{f}$
i.e. initial and final potential energies are equal. 

velocity of approach (initially) = velocity of separation (finally)
