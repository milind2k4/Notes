# Oblique Collision 
Along common surface or along direction perpendicular to line of impact, there will be no change in momentum and  thus velocity. 
$$v\sin \phi = u\sin \theta$$

Now, along line of impact,
$$e = \frac{ \text{velocity of sep. along LOI} }{ \text{velocity of appr. along LOI} }$$
$$e = \frac{ v\cos \phi }{ u\cos \theta }$$
$$v\cos \phi = eu\cos \theta$$

Thus, net velocity,
$$v = u\sqrt{ \sin ^{2}\theta + e^{2}\cos ^{2}\theta }$$
Which will be at an angle,
$$\tan \phi = \frac{ u\sin \theta }{ eu\cos \theta } = \frac{ \tan \theta }{ e }$$

If e = 1, i.e. elastic collision,
$$v = u$$
$$\phi = \theta$$


#### Realistic Projectile with n Strikes
Using this we can find the range, maximum heights and time of flight for a real projection which hits the ground n times. 

Time for nth flight,
$$t_{n} = e^{n-1}t_{1}$$
where $t_{1}$ is the time of flight for the first flight. 

Thus the total time of flight,
$$
\begin{split}
T &= \sum_{i = 1}^{n} t_{n} \\
&= t_{1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} e^{n-1} \\
&= t_{1} \left( \frac{ 1(1 - e^{n}) }{ 1 - e } \right) \\
\end{split}
$$
Thus time of flight,
$$T = \frac{ 2u\sin \theta }{ g } \frac{ 1-e^{ n } }{ 1 - e }$$

Range can be found by $u_{x}T$ as the velocity in the horizontal direction is constant. 

The maximum height of the nth flight will be,
$$H_{n} = H_{1} e^{ 2(n-1) }$$
where $H_{1}$ is the height of the first flight.

### Oblique Collision between Balls
Two balls of masses $m_{1}$, $m_{2}$ with velocities $v_{1}$, $v_{2}$ and with radii $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ are colliding. 

The separation between the lines of motion of the balls is called **Impact Parameter** and is denoted by r.

The common normal is the line of impact. 

The angle between the LOM and LOI is $\theta$ where,
$$\sin \theta = \frac{ r }{ R_{1} + R_{2} }$$

The velocities along the common tangent remain unchanged. I.e. $u_{1}\sin \theta$ and $u_{2}\sin \theta$ remain unchanged. 

Now, conserving momentum of the system along LOI,
$$m_{1}u_{1}\cos \theta - m_{2}u_{2}\cos \theta = m_{1}v_{1} + m_{2}v_{2}$$

Now, coefficient of restitution,
$$e = \frac{ v_{2} - v_{1} }{ u_{1}\cos \theta + u_{2}\cos \theta }$$

From these two equations we can solve for $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$. 

![[Pasted image 20230708130838.png]]

The final velocity of ball 1 will be the resultant of $v_{1}$ and $u_{1}\sin \theta$ and that of ball 2 will be resultant of $v_{2}$ and $u_{2}\sin \theta$.
