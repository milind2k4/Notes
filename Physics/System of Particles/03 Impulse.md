# Impulse
Change in motion depends on force applied as well as time interval for which it is applied. 

$$d\vec{J} = \vec{f}dt$$
$$\vec{J} = \int \vec{f} \, dt $$

When force is constant,
$$\vec{J} = \vec{f}t$$

Impulse is a vector quantity and is along force. 
Its unit is $\ce{ N s }$ or $\ce{ kg m s^{-1} }$ with dimensions $\ce{ [MLT^{-1}] }$.

The area under the curve f-t graph provides Impulse.

### Impulse Momentum Theorem
$$
\begin{split}
\vec{J} &= \int \vec{f} \, dt \\
&= \int m \frac{ d\vec{v} }{ dt } \, dt \\
&= \int m \, d\vec{v} \\
&= m(\vec{v}_{f} - \vec{v}_{i}) \\
&= \vec{P}_{f} - \vec{P}_{i} \\   
\end{split}
$$

Thus, the impulse of net force on an object is always equal to change in linear momentum of object or system. 

$$\vec{J} = \Delta \vec{P}$$
The impulse is in the direction of change in momentum. 

For example, we can use impulse to find $\mu_{k}$,

## Force Applied by Rainfall/Hailstorm
m is the mass of raindrop or hailstone. 

$\vec{P}_{i}$ is the initial momentum of a hailstone. 
$\vec{P}_{f}$ is the final momentum of a hailstone. 

Let N number of hailstones strike the surface in $\Delta t$ time.

Now, change in momentum of 1 hailstone
$$\Delta \vec{P} = \vec{P}_{f} - \vec{P}_{i}$$
For N hailstones, change in momentum, $N\Delta \vec{P}$.

Force on N hailstones 
$$\vec{f} = \frac{ d\vec{P} }{ dt } = \frac{ N\Delta \vec{P} }{ \Delta t }$$
Force by striking hailstones,
$$\vec{f} = \frac{ N\Delta P }{ \Delta t } = n\Delta P$$
where n is the no. of hailstones striking per unit time.

## Impulsive Forces
They are forces which can change the motion of particle a considerable amount in a small time interval. 

Gravitational force is not an impulsive force. 
However, the normal by the ground is impulsive as it changes momentum in a very small amount of time.

However, this impulsive force is not an absolute term. 

There are some basic rules for determination of impulsive forces,
1. Gravitational force and spring force are always non impulsive. 
2. Contact forces during impact or collision are, in general, impulsive. 
3. Only an impulsive force can balance another impulsive force. 

The same force can be impulsive for one object and non impulsive for another. 


For a non impulsive force in a small time interval, $I = fdt = dP \to 0$.
Thus *non impulsive forces cannot change momentum in infinitely small time interval.*
Thus we can ignore and hence conserve momentum in presence of non impulsive force if the time interval is very small ($\to 0$).
