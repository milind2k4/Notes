# Examples
#### COM
We put all the mass of the extended bodies at the COM,

We can also find the energy of explosion if we know the velocities of each part,
![[Pasted image 20230704115214.png]]

This energy found however, is the minimum energy of explosion. As there will heat light sound etc also coming out.

##### When COM is not fixed

We can apply LMC in the direction which has no net external force. 

We have to take care to take the velocities from the ground,

In Spring Problems where one of the blocks is not fixed, the velocity of both the blocks is constant when the compression is maximum.

![[Pasted image 20230704124614.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230704124633.png]]

Similarly for opposite situation, i.e. when blocks are moving apart,
![[Pasted image 20230704173330.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230704174447.png]]

In other questions too, we have this situation where the final velocities are equal,
![[Pasted image 20230704174519.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230704174607.png]]

While a block is on another, it will apply a force and thus the velocity will always increase.

##### Explosions
![[Pasted image 20230704182110.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230704182152.png]]

This question can be done alternatively by using the result that COM is not affected by internal forces and thus will not deviate from the original parabolic path. 
![[Pasted image 20230704182858.png]]

#### From the COM
We can also do questions from the COM. It might make things easier. 
From the COM, the blocks have no external force and thus the momentum is conserved.  

Wrt the COM, even if both the blocks are moving the COM will be at rest.

![[Pasted image 20230704185255.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230704185307.png]]

But we will have to use Work Energy Theorem as the forces have some work done.

#### [[04 Collisions]]

In many collision questions, we do not need to find the individual velocities. We can also get the hint that we should not calculate the individual values by the value of masses or velocities.
Here we can see that the masses are 13 and 17 gm which are not very nice numbers.

#### [[05 Variable Mass System]]
Thrust force can be separated into components along velocities.
![[Pasted image 20230709214134.png]]

Here, the thrust force is divided into the two velocities that make up the relative velocity of the sand.

This question can also be solved using momentum conservation,

![[Pasted image 20230709220207.png]]

This question can also be done by IMT,
