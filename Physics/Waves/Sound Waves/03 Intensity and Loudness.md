# Intensity of Sound Wave
[[00 Waves#Intensity of Wave]]

Intensity is the power per unit cross sectional area. 

In terms of displacement amplitude,
$$I = 2\pi^{2}f^{2}s_{o}^{2}\rho v$$
In terms of pressure amplitude,
$$
\begin{split}
I &= 2\pi^{2}f^{2} \frac{ p_{o}^{2} }{ B^{2}k^{2} } \rho v \\ 
&= 2\pi^{2} f^{2} \frac{ p_{o}^{2} }{ \rho^{2} v^{4} } \frac{ v^{2} }{ \omega^{2} } \rho v \\
&= 2\pi^{2} f^{2} \frac{ p_{o}^{2} }{ \rho v } \frac{ 1 }{ 4\pi^{2}f^{2} } \\
&= \frac{ p_{o}^{2} }{ 2\rho v }
\end{split}
$$


Hence, 
$$
\begin{split}
I &\propto f^{2} \\
&\propto s_{o}^{2} \\
&\propto p_{o}^{2}
\end{split}
$$

#### Point Source
Let a point source S give out power P.

This power spreads on an imaginary sphere of ever increasing radius. 

Thus we can write intensity,
$$I = \frac{ P }{ 4\pi r^{2} }$$

Hence, 
$$I \propto \frac{1}{r^{2}}$$
From this,
$$p_{o} \propto s_{o} \propto \frac{1}{r}$$

Now, power incident on an ear drum of area $\Delta A$,
$$P' = I\Delta A = \frac{ P \Delta A }{ 4\pi r^{2} }$$

#### Line Source 
We take the source to be an infinitely long thin wire. 

The power coming out of the source is spread on the curved surface of an imaginary cylinder. 

The intensity thus is,
$$I = \frac{ P }{ 2\pi rl }$$

Thus,
$$I \propto \frac{ 1 }{ r }$$

This gives,
$$p_{o} \propto s_{o} \propto \frac{ 1 }{ \sqrt{ r } }$$

### Loudness
Our ears do not perceive sound directely proportional to intensity.

The most audible frequency for our ears is 1k Hz. 

The least intensity our ears can hear is,
$$I_{o} = 10^{-12}\ \ce{ W/m^{2} }$$

Loudness is a logarithmic scale of intensity. It is defined as,
$$\beta = 10 \log_{10} \frac{ I }{ I_{o} }$$

The unit of loudness is **decibel** (dB)

When the intensity falling on our ears is $10^{-12}$ W/m$^{2}$, the loudness is 0.

For every tenfold increase in intensity, the loudness increases by 10 units.
