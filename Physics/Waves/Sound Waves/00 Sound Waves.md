# Sound Waves
Sound waves are mechanical & longitudinal 3D wave. 
Its source is a vibrating object. Like a tuning fork, diaphragm of a speaker or vocal chords.

The frequency of the source will be the frequency of the sound wave.

Human ears can hear frequencies from 20 to 20k Hz. 
Sounds having frequencies less than 20 Hz are called **Infrasonic.**
Sounds having frequencies less than 20 kHz are called **Ultrasonic.**

**Pitch:** Brain interprets sound primarily in terms of subjective quality known as Pitch. The higher the f, the higher is the pitch. 
The lower the pitch is, the heavier is the sound. 
The higher the pitch is, the sharper is the sound.

## Reflection of Sound Wave 
[[00 Waves#Reflection and Transmission of Waves]]

#### Reflection by Closed End 
[[00 Waves#Reflection by Fixed Wall]]

Let the incident wave be $s_{i}$ and the reflected wave be $s_{r}$. 

The longitudinal displacement of the point of reflection will be zero,
$$
\begin{split}
s &= s_{i} + s_{r} \\
s_{i} + s_{r} &= 0 \\
s_{r} &= -s_{i}
\end{split}
$$

Thus the displacement of reflected wave will be opposite to that of the incident wave. 

Thus at closed end, there is node of displacement and the incident and reflected wave have a phase difference of $\pi$, i.e. they will be out of phase. 

Since there is node of displacement at closed end and pressure and displacement are out of phase by $\pi /2$, there will be Anti-node of pressure at the closed end. 

Thus the incident and reflected pressure wave will be in the same phase. I.e. if incident is compression pulse, the reflection will also be compression pulse.

#### Reflection by Open End
[[00 Waves#Reflection by Free End]]

The air inside the pipe and outside are not the same because inside the pipe, the air molecules also experience attraction by the pipe. Thus the air molecules inside are less free than the ones outside. 

The open end will have anti node of displacement wave, i.e. the reflected and incident waves will be in the same phase.

And it will have node of pressure wave, i.e. the reflected and incident waves will be out of phase.

## Beats
If two incoherent sources of angular frequencies $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$ interfere at a point, the resulting intensity will be,
$$I_{res} = I_{1} + I_{2} + 2\sqrt{ I_{1}I_{2} } \cos \Delta \phi$$
Now, since $\Delta \phi$ will have the term $(\omega_{2} - \omega_{1})t$, the resulting intensity will be a function of time. 

If the angular frequencies of the sources are similar but not the same, we will be able to hear this increase and decrease in intensity.

These fluctuations of intensity are called **beats.**

If the difference in angular frequencies is large however, the change in intensity will be very quick and we will not be able to hear beats. We will only be able to hear the average intensity,
$$I_{avg} = I_{1} + I_{2}$$

The beat frequency is the difference between the frequencies of the sources,
$$f_{b} = \frac{ 1 }{ T_{b} } = |f_{1} - f_{2}|$$

(there is square on max. intensity)

Human ears can hear beat frequencies less than or equal to 14 Hz. 
Over that, we only hear the average intensity. 

Note that,
- Filing a tuning fork will reduce the mass of the prongs which increases the frequency. 
- Loading (or waxing) a tuning fork will increases the mass of the prongs and decrease the frequency.
