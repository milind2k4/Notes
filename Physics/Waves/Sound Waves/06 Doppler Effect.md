# Doppler Effect
#removed from jee 24

Whenever there is a velocity of approach or separation between the source and the observer, the observer does not hear the sound of the same frequency as the source, but either more or less than it. 

If they are approaching each other, the effective frequency will be more than the source frequency.  
If they are separating from each other, the effective frequency will be less than the source frequency.  

$$f_{app} = \left( \frac{ c \pm v_{o} }{ c \pm v_{s} } \right) f_{o}$$
where $c$ is speed of sound.

Thus, for example,

$$f_{app} = \left( \frac{ 350 - 10 }{ 350 - 20 } \right) \times 1000$$

$$f_{app} = \left( \frac{ 350 + 10 }{ 350 + 20 } \right) \times 1000$$

For reflection problems,

![[Pasted image 20230214104844.png]]

there are 2 doppler effects, one when going towards the wall, one when the wall reflects the sound and the observer moving towards the wall. 
The first time, the source is the object going towards the wall, the second time the source is the wall.
