# Wave front and Huygens Principle
## Creation of Wave front
#### Point source
Wave front created by a point source is an imaginary sphere with centre at the source. 

Time taken to go from one wave front to another along any path is the same. 

Each point on the sphere has the same phase at the same time. The phase changes with the time, but it is the same for all the points on the sphere.

#### Parallel Beam 
Here, the source is at Infinity
Wave front created by parallel beam is an imaginary plane.

#### Infinitely long Line Source
Wave front created by line source is an imaginary cylinder whose axis is the source itself.

## Huygens' Principle
Every point on a wavefront is itself is another source called secondary source.

They generate spherical wavelets called secondary wavelets.

The common surface of these wavelets in the direction of the wave is the next wavefront.

### Verification of Laws for Boards
#### Reflection
![[reflection.png]]

If v is the speed of wave and $\uptau$ the time taken by it to advance from B to C, then the distance $BC = v\uptau$ 

To construct the reflected wavefront, we draw a sphere of radius $v\uptau$ from point A as shown. Let CE represent the tangent plane drawn from the point C to the sphere. 

And $AE = BC = v\uptau$.

Now the triangles EAC and BAC are congruent and thus $i = r$. This is the law of reflection. 

#### Refraction
![[Rarer to Denser.png]]

By the time point A of the incident wavefront touches the refracting surface, point B has yet to travel distance BC to touch the refracting surface at C. 

When point B falls on the surface, point A would have reached D. 

The time taken $\uptau$ for the ray to travel from B to C is the same as the time taken to travel A to D.

$$t = \frac{ BC }{ v_{1} } = \frac{ AD }{ v_{2} }$$
$$t = \frac{ BC }{ AD } = \frac{v_{1}}{v_{2}}$$

For the two right angled triangles ABC and CDA,
$$\frac{ \sin i }{ \sin r } = \frac{ BC / AC }{ AD / AC } = \frac{ BC }{ AD } = \frac{v_{1}}{v_{2}}$$

Therefore,
$$\frac{ \sin i  }{ \sin r } = \frac{ c / v_{1} }{ c / v_{2} } = \frac{n_{1}}{n_{2}}$$
Which is Snell's law.
