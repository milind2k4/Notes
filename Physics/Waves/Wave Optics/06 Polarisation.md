# Polarisation of Light
A light wave in which the electric and magnetic fields can oscillate in any direction perpendicular to the speed of light, is called **Unpolarized.**
E and B will oscillate in any direction in the plane perpendicular to the speed. 

We represent unpolarized light as,

If we allow the electric field to move in only one direction perpendicular to the speed then the light wave is said to be **Polarised.**

We represent polarized light as,

Thus polarisation means that we remove one component of light and allow the other to pass through. The intensity halves when polarizing.

### Methods to Polarize
We can polarize light by some polaroid glass or some specific polymers.

#### Dichroism
We use Dichrome crystal to polarize light.
The crystal is also called Polarizer.

#### By Reflection 
**By Brewster Law**

The angle of incidence at which reflected ray is fully polarized is called *Brewster Angle ($i_{B}$).*

If reflected ray is fully polarised, then reflected and refracted rays are perpendicular to each other. 
The refracted ray will be partially polarized.

From the diagram,
$$
\begin{split}
i_{B} + 90 + r &= 180 \\
r &= 90 - i_{B}
\end{split}
$$

Using Snell's Law,
$$
\begin{split}
1 \sin i_{B} &= \mu\sin r \\
&= \mu\sin(90^{\circ} - i_{B}) \\
&= \mu \cos i\\
\tan i_{B} &= \mu \\
i_{B} &= \tan ^{-1}n
\end{split}
$$
Thus the Brewster angle is,
$$i_{B} = \tan ^{-1}\mu$$

Thus, for a glass of refractive index $\sqrt{ 3 }$, the Brewster angle is $60^{\circ}$ for polarisation.

If we exchange the denser and rarer medium,
$$i = \tan ^{-1} \frac{1}{n}$$

#### By Refraction
We put parallel transparent slabs and incident light at Brewster angle.

Now the refracted ray will be again polarized and so on. 

The refracted ray will get closer to being completely polarized by each subsequent polarization.

### Variation of Intensity on Polarization 
The intensity of light after polarization will be less than that of the incident light. 

We know that,
$$
\begin{split}
I &\propto E^{2} \\
I_{o} &= kE_{o}^{2}
\end{split}
$$

Now, the E will have components along the parallel and perpendicular directions to the transmission axis. 

After polarization, the intensity will be,
$$I = kE_{o}^{2}\cos ^{2}\theta$$

The average intensity will be,
$$I = \frac{ kE_{o}^{2} }{ 2 } = \frac{ I_{o} }{ 2 }$$

Thus, after polarization, the intensity becomes half.

#### Malus's Law
If we polarize an already polarized light by putting the new polarizer at an angle $\theta$ with the first, the intensity of the now double polarized light will be $\cos ^{2}\theta$ times the intensity before the second polarizer. 

The 2nd polarizer absorbs the perpendicular component of the light.
