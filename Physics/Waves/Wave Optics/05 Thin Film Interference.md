# Thin Film Interference
[[00 Wave Optics#Interference of 2 Coherent Waves]]

Thin film means a transparent medium of refractive index $\mu$ and thickness in the order of micrometre, $t$.
Both the surfaces 1 and 2 are partially reflecting and refracting. 

A light is incident on it whose wavelength is $\lambda$.

When the light is incident on the film, some part of it is reflected back into the medium. 

And some part is transmitted (refracted) into the film. 

Now again at the 2nd surface, some part of this transmitted wave is transmitted into vacuum and some part of it is reflected back into the film.

Again, when the reflected ray is incident on the 1st surface, some part of it is transmitted into vacuum and some of it is reflected back into the film.

If at the 1st surface, R and TRT constructively interfere, it appears to glow and is said to *strongly reflect.*

#### Top Surface (Surface 1)
Now, if R and TRT do constructive interference,
$$
\begin{split}
2\mu t - \frac{ \lambda }{ 2 } &= n\lambda \\
2\mu t &= (n+1 /2)\lambda \\
\lambda &= \frac{ 4\mu t }{ 2n+1 } \\
&= \frac{ 4\mu t }{ \text{odd} }
\end{split}
$$

These are the $\lambda$ which will glow on the surface. 

If R and TRT do destructive interference, the colours will appear dark,
$$
\begin{split}
2\mu t - \frac{ \lambda }{ 2 } &= (2n+1) \frac{ \lambda }{ 2 } \\
2\mu t &= n\lambda \\
\lambda &= \frac{ 2\mu t }{ n }
\end{split} 
$$
These are the $\lambda$ which will appear dark on the surface.

#### Bottom Surface (Surface 2) 
Here, instead of R and TRT, we have the waves, TT and TRRT.

Now, if they undergo constructive interference, surface 2 will appear to glow, and we can write,
$$
\begin{split}
2\mu t &= n\lambda \\
\lambda &= \frac{ 2\mu t }{ n }
\end{split}
$$
These are the same wavelengths which are weakly reflected by the first surface. 

If they undergo destructive interference, surface 2 will appear to be dark, we can write,
$$
\begin{split}
2\mu t &= (n - 1 /2) \lambda \\
\lambda &= \frac{ 4\mu t }{ 2n-1 } \\
&= \frac{ 4\mu t }{ \text{odd} }
\end{split}
$$
These are the same wavelengths which are strongly reflected by the first surface.
