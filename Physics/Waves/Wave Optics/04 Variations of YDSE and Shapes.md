# Variations of YDSE and Shape of Interference Pattern
## Variations of YDSE
### Fresnel Biprism 
[[13 Prism#Small Angled Prism]]

There is a single slit, then a biprism of refractive index $\mu$ at a distance a from it, and finally a screen b distance from the biprism. 

The apex angle of the biprism is small.

Due to the prism, the light deviates, and the single slit appear to be two. These $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ are called secondary slits. 

The separation between them is,
$$
\begin{split}
S_{1}S_{2} &= 2a\delta \\
&= 2a(\mu-1)A 
\end{split}
$$

The fringe width of the pattern formed will be,
$$
\begin{split}
\beta &= \frac{ \lambda D }{ d } \\
&= \frac{ \lambda(a+b) }{ 2a(\mu-1)A }
\end{split}
$$

### Lloyed Mirror 
There is a single slit h distance (h is small) above a mirror of length $l$ which is a distance from the slit and b distance from screen. 

Due to reflection by mirror, the wave coming at any point P will have two sources. 
The distance between these sources will be,
$$SS' = d = 2h$$


The path difference at P will be, ($\lambda /2$ is due to reflection by glass)
$$
\begin{split}
\Delta x &= (S'P - SP) + \frac{ \lambda }{ 2 } \\
&= 2h\sin \theta + \frac{ \lambda }{ 2 } \\
&= 2h\tan \theta + \frac{ \lambda }{ 2 } \\
&= \frac{ 2hy }{ (a+l+b) } + \frac{ \lambda }{ 2 }
\end{split}
$$

Fringe width will be,
$$\beta = \frac{ \lambda(a+l+b) }{ 2h }$$

## Shape of Interference Pattern 
#### Pin Holes in Cardboard 
The central maxima will be a straight line. 

The rest maxima will be hyperbolas.

#### Sources in Front of Each Other 
The path difference will be $d\cos \theta$. This path difference will depend on $\theta$ and thus a bright circle will be formed. 

Thus, maxima will be concentric circles.

#### Slits in Cardboard 
Near the centre, the pattern will be straight lines like usual. 

When we go far up or far down on the screen, the slits will behave like point sources and thus pattern will be hyperbola.
