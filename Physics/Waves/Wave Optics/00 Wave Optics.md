# Wave Optics
#### Newton's Corpuscular Theory (1675)
In 1675, Newton gave the Corpuscular theory of Light. 
He said that light is a particle and called it "Corpuscle".
This particle is very small and elastic.
In denser medium it travels slowly and in rarer it travels faster. 

#### Huygens Wave Theory (1678)
In 1678, Huygens gave the Wave theory of Light. 
He said, light is longitudinal, mechanical wave.
He proposed a term **Wave front.**

**Wave front:** An imaginary surface, on which each point has the same phase. 
$$or$$
It is locus of the points oscillating in the same phase.

The direction of velocity of wave is always perpendicular to the wave front. Moving from one wave front to another takes an equal amount of time everywhere.

### Maxwell's EM wave theory
[[00 EM Wave]]

In 1873, Maxwell gave the EM theory of Light. 
He said, light is transverse, non-mechanical wave.
He proposed that it is a combination of varying Electric and Magnetic fields. 

$$\vec{E} = \vec{B} \times \vec{c}$$

The equation of light can be written as,
$$E = E_{o}\sin(\upomega t - kx + \theta)$$
where E is electric field. 

### Reflection and Transmission of Light
When reflection is by denser medium, we add a phase difference of $\pi$ or a path difference of $\lambda /2$. 

If the reflection is at rarer medium, we do not add anything. 

Transmission is the same as refraction. 

## Interference of 2 Coherent Waves
[[02 Interference]]

##### Definition and Condition for Boards
Waves having the same angular frequency are called **coherent**.

Two sources are said to be coherent if they produce waves having the same frequency, waveform and constant phase difference between them. 

Conditions for Sustained Interference,
1. Sources must be coherent.
2. Sources must have the same plane of polarisation.
3. The sources must be monochromatic.
4. The source must be small enough to be considered a point source.
5. The sources must be close to each other and the pattern must be observed at a larger distance.

#### Resultant A and I
The phase difference is, 
$$\Delta \phi = k\Delta x = \frac{ 2\pi }{ \lambda }\Delta x$$

The amplitude of the resultant wave is given by,
$$E_{res} = \sqrt{ E_{1}^{2} + E_{2}^{2} + 2E_{1}E_{2}\cos \Delta\phi }$$

The resultant intensity will be,
$$I_{res} = I_{2} + I_{2} + 2\sqrt{ I_{1}I_{2} }\cos \Delta \phi$$

For good contrast, we take sources with same intensities.

## Optical Length
Let a transparent medium have length l and refractive index n and light travels through it. 

The distance l that light travels through the medium is called *geometrical length.*

The phase difference when light travels $l$ length in medium of refractive index $n$, and the phase difference when it travels a distance $nl$ in vacuum will be the same.

This $nl$ is called optical length.

I.e. travelling $l$ distance in $n$ refractive index is the same as travelling $nl$ distance in air.

## Doppler Effect in Light
[[06 Doppler Effect]]
#removed from jee 24

When we observe a body which is going away from us we observe more wavelength than the source actually emitted. This is called red shift, as the light coming to us gets shifter towards the red side of the spectrum. 

$$\frac{ \Delta \lambda  }{ \lambda } = \frac{ v }{ c }$$

if the body is going away from us, we observe less wavelength. This is called blue shift as the light coming is shifted towards the blue side of the spectrum.
