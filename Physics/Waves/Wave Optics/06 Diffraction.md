# Diffraction
Whenever light encounters a hindrance in its path whose dimension are of the order of its wavelength, it spreads in all directions on contact with it. This phenomenon is called **Diffraction.**

### Single Slit Diffraction
The central maxima has most of the light, and the central fringe is the widest. 

The first maxima will have intensity $I_{o} /22$. 
The second maxima will have intensity $I_{o} /61$.

#### Minima
The position of the minima is given by,
$$a\sin \theta = n\lambda$$
In general $\theta$ is small and thus we can write,
$$\theta = \frac{ n\lambda }{ a }$$

Thus the first minima will be at,
$$\theta_{1} = \pm\frac{ \lambda }{ a }$$

The second minima will be at,
$$\theta_{2} = \frac{ 2\lambda }{ a }$$
and so on.

#### Maxima 
The central maxima will be the point in front of the slit. 

The position of maxima is given by,
$$\sin \theta = (2n+1) \frac{ \lambda }{ 2a },\ n \neq 0$$
If angle is small,
$$\theta = (2n+1) \frac{ \lambda }{ 2a },\ n \neq 0$$

The first maxima will be at,
$$\theta_{1} = \frac{ 3\lambda }{ 2a }$$

The second maxima will be at,
$$\theta_{2} = \frac{ 5\lambda }{ 2a }$$
and so on.

#### Central Fringe Width 
The maxima between the two first minima is the central maxima.

The central fringe width is,
$$\beta = 2D\theta = \frac{ 2\lambda D }{ a }$$
This is twice the size of the non-central fringe width.

In **Franhoffer Diffraction** a lens is placed in front of the slit. 
In this case, we replace D with $f$ of the lens.
$$\beta = \frac{ 2f\lambda }{ a }$$

### Diffraction by Circular Aperture
Here, instead of slit, we have pin hole of diameter b. 

In this case, instead of straight lines, we get circles. The central circle is called **Airy Disk**

![[Pasted image 20240208203208.png]]

The angle made by the airy disk,
$$\sin \theta = \frac{ 1.22\lambda }{ b }$$

Then the radius of airy disk,
$$R = D\theta = \frac{ 1.22D\lambda }{ b }$$

If the diameter of the pinhole is increased, the radius of the airy disk will decrease, but its intensity will increase as more light will pass through. 

For Franhoffer diffraction, lens is placed at the pinhole, and we replace $D$ with the focal length.
$$R = \frac{ 1.22\lambda f }{ b }$$

### Difference between Interference and Diffraction
(for boards)

| Interference                                                | Diffraction                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The contrast between maxima and minima is very good         | The contrast between maxima and minima is very poor                       |
| The width of the fringes is equal                           | The central fringe is twice as wide                                       |
| Occurs due to superposition of light waves from two sources | Occurs due to superposition of light waves from a large number of sources |
| All bright bands are of same intensity                      | The central band is more intense than the other bands                     |

## Resolving Limit
#removed from jee24

Two light sources little distance apart, seem to be the one source when looked from very far away. As we gat closer, the angle subtended by it increases and we see them as different. 

![[Pasted image 20240208203942.png]]

Thus, if two sources seem as single source, it means that the image is not resolved. If they seem as two different sources, then we say that the image is resolved. 

![[Pasted image 20240208203929.png]]

The angle at which they are just resolved is called **Resolving Limit.**
$$\theta_{o} = \frac{d_{o}}{l}$$
Thus if, $\theta \geq \theta_{o}$ then the image is Resolved.
And if, $\theta < \theta_{o}$ then the image is Not Resolved.

**Resolving Power** is the reciprocal of **Resolving Limit**,
$$R.P = \frac{1}{R.L} = \frac{1}{\theta_{o}}$$

### Telescope
(also for lens)

The resolving limit,
$$RL = \frac{d_{o}}{l} = d\theta = \frac{1.22\lambda}{a}$$
where a is the diameter of the lens.

### Microscope

$$RL = \frac{d_{o}}{l} = \frac{ \lambda  }{ 2\mu \sin \theta }$$

Thus,
$$RL \propto \lambda$$
