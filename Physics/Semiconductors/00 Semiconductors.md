# Semiconductors
aka **Electronics.**

Which are less conducting than metals (conductors) and more conducting than insulators.

In conductors, as we increase temp., resistance increases. In SC, as we increase temp., resistance decreases. 

In SC, we can control i, J, E, $\sigma, \rho$ etc. by n no. of ways. Like temperature, doping, light incident and many more. 

In SC, it is easy to control currents.

Most SC are 14th group elements. Mostly Silicon and Germanium. 

Electron density,
$$n_{e} = \frac{\text{no of free e}}{\text{volume}}$$
Hole density,
$$n_{h} = \frac{\text{no of holes}}{\text{volume}}$$

Note: GaAs is a compound SC.

#### Two Closely Placed Atoms 
It is possible that if we bring two atoms close together in a crystal, the outer shells overlap. 

The outermost e will move under the influence of both the nuclei. 

This e is called free e and it can freely move in the lattice. This e is said to be in the **conduction band** and is responsible for transfer of current. 

The other e are called **bounded e** and cannot move in the lattice. They are said to be in **valence band.**

Similarly, if there are many atoms in a crystal,

#### Fermi Energy 
 The energy of the highest e of an atom at 0 K is called Fermi Energy. 
$$or$$
At 0 K, the max energy of valence band is known as fermi energy. 

At T > 0 K, e may have energy more than fermi energy.

#### Electron - Hole pair Generation 
The e which are in bonds are said to be in valence band. 

Due to temp. or thermal agitation, this e can come out of this bond. This will make the e a free e. 

This e is said to be in conduction band.

The deficiency of e in the bond is called hole represented as h. It practically has +e charge. 

This process of ejecting an e from bond is called e-h pair generation.

On application of electric field, it is possible that another e will become free and fill another hole. The current due to this is $i_{h}$. 
And,
$$
\begin{split}
i_{h} &< i_{e} \\
i &= i_{e} + i_{h}
\end{split}
$$

Also, the act of accepting an e is called e hole pair combination.

### Band Diagrams 
##### Conductors 
In conductors, the valence and conduction bands are overlapping. 

This means that e can go from VB to CB with very little energy. And thus there is a large no. of free e.

In metals, at 0 K, the conduction band and valence band are very close. At T > 0 K the bands overlap and e can move freely to the conduction band.

##### Insulators 
In insulators, the valence and conduction bands have a large energy gap.

This energy gap is called **Forbidden/Fermi Energy Gap.**
This gap is more than 5eV for insulators. 
$$\Delta E_{g} > 5 \text{ eV}$$

Thus in insulators, it is hard to remove e and make it free.

##### Semiconductors 
In SC, the valence and conduction bands are not overlapping, but the forbidden energy gap is not as high as 5 eV. 

In SC, the forbidden energy is less than 2 eV.

Conductivity,
$$\text{Conductors > SC > Insulators}$$ 

Now, if we increase the temp., more and more e will go from VB into the CB. Thus increasing the conductivity.
