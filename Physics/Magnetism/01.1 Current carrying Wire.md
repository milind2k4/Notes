# B due to Current Carrying Wire
aka **Biot Savart's Law** #important 

Magnetic  field due to a small current carrying element.

We take a vector $d \vec{l}$ along current having magnitude as the length of the small element. 

The magnetic field due to it will be,
$$\begin{split}
B &\propto idl \\
&\propto \sin \theta \\
&\propto \frac{1}{r^{2}} \\
\end{split}$$

Thus, we get,
$$B = \frac{\mu_{o}}{4\pi} \frac{ idl\sin \theta }{ r^{2} }$$

In vector form,
$$\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_{o}}{4\pi} \frac{ i(d\vec{l} \times \vec{r}) }{ r^{3} }$$
Thus the direction will be along $d\vec{l} \times \vec{r}$

#### B due to Straight Wire 
[[03.2 Wire]]

To find the direction, we extend our right hand thumb in the direction of the current and curl our fingers. The direction of the curl is the direction of the magnetic field.

The magnitude of this magnetic field is,
$$B = \frac{ \mu_{o} }{ 4\pi } \frac{ i }{ r } (\sin \theta_{1} + \sin \theta_{2})$$

##### Infinitely Long Wire
Here, $\theta_{1} = \theta_{2} = 90^{\circ}$

Thus, we get,
$$B = \frac{ \mu_{o} i }{ 2\pi r }$$

And the magnetic lines of forces are concentric circles.

##### Semi-infinitely Long Wire
One of the ends is at $\infty$. 

The magnetic field comes out to be half of that of infinitely long wire at P.
$$B = \frac{ \mu_{o}i }{ 4\pi r }$$
