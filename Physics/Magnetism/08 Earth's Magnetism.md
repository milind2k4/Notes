# Earth's Magnetism
The angle between the magnetic north and the actual north is **11.3 degrees.**

The magnetic north is actually close to the actual south and vice-versa. 

The vertical plane joining the actual north and south is called **Geographical Meridian.** 

The vertical plane along which a freely suspended bar magnet aligns itself is called the **Magnetic Meridian.** Or vertical plane containing the magnetic field due to earth. 

The angle between Geographic and Magnetic Meridian is called **Angle of Declination (D or $\delta$).** 

The line perpendicular to the magnet is **Magnetic Equator.**

#### Angle of Dip
aka **Angle of Inclination**

It is not necessary that a freely suspended bar magnet is horizontal. It dips at some places. 

This shows that the magnetic field of earth is not always horizontal and the angle the bar magnet makes with the horizontal is called the **Angle of Dip (I or $\theta$)**.  

At the magnetic poles, angle of dip is 90 degrees and at magnetic equator, the angle of dip is zero.
