# Ferromagnetic Substances
E.g. Fe, Co, Ni

They are similar to paramagnetic substances. 

These have macroscopic domains. In one domain, all the dipoles are aligned. The sizes of these domains depends upon the external field.  Domain is a macroscopic region with saturation magnetization. 

On applying external magnetic field, the domains which are aligned with the external magnetic field increase in size, while the others shrink. 

$$\mu_{r} > \mu_{r(para)}$$
$$\chi > \chi_{para} > 1$$

$$B_{int} \gg B_{ext}$$

It attracts magnetic lines of forces and magnets.

#### Hard Ferromagnetic Substances
Where it is hard to magnetize and demagnetize. I.e. it is hard to move dipoles. The diploes are rigid. The energy loss is high in moving the dipoles.


#### Soft Ferromagnetic Substances
Where it is easy to magnetize and demagnetize. I.e. it is easy to move dipoles. The dipoles are not rigid. The energy loss is low in moving the dipoles.

### Hysteresis 
#removed from jee 24

It is only for ferromagnetic substance. 

At first there is no external field (magnetic intensity) and thus no intensity of magnetisation. 

As we increase H, the domains align themselves. This creates a magnetic dipole moment and thus I increases. Here I vs H curve is not linear. In paramagnetic it is linear. 

After one point, all the domains are aligned, and thus the net dipole moment, and in turn I becomes max.

Now, as we decrease the applied H, the net dipole moment also decreases. But, when H becomes zero, the domains do not go to their previous positions. Thus I does not become zero. 

To make I zero, we have to apply H in the opposite direction. 

Now, if we keep increasing H in the opposite direction, the same thing happens. 

Finally, we get the graph.

The area of the graph is directly proportional to the amount of energy lost, called **Hysteresis Loss.** 

It is high for Hard ferromagnetic substance and less for soft ferromagnetic substance. 
For permanent magnet and hard ferromagnetic substances, Retentivity$\uparrow$ and Coercivity$\uparrow$

Due to this loss, transformers are made from soft iron and permanent magnets are made from hard iron.
