# Spherical Aberration 
When a ray strikes a spherical mirror, it passes through the principal axis at a point which is
$$x = \frac{R}{2}\sec i$$
distance from the centre of curvature. This can be derived using sine law, or geometry, as shown,

**Spherical Aberration:** It is the incapability of a spherical mirror to focus Reflected rays at a single point.

## Removal
1. Use parabolic mirror. This is the reason why the headlights in cars have parabolic mirror.

2. Use spherical mirror of small aperture. 
   
   Since i is very small, $\sec i \to 1$ thus $x = \displaystyle \frac{R}{2}\sec i = \frac{R}{2}$

	- **Paraxial Rays:** Rays having very small angle of incidence and are very close to principal axis.
