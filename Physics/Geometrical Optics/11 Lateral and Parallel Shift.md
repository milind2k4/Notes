## Normal Shift by Parallel Slab
A parallel slab shifts the image towards the incident rays. 

The image is seen a little bit in front, by
$$s = t - \frac{ t }{ n }$$
where,
$t \to$ thickness of slab 
$n \to$ refractive index of medium of slab 

For surface 1, O is object and $I_{1}$ is image,
thus image formed is, 
$$d_{i} nd_{o}$$
$$AI_{1} = n(AO)$$

For surface 2, $I_{1}$ is object and $I_{2}$ is image,
$$d_{i} = \frac{ d_{o} }{ n }$$
$$BI_{2} = \frac{ t + n(AO) }{ n }$$
$$BI_{2} = AO + \frac{t}{n}$$

Thus normal shift,
$$s = t + AO - (AO - t /n)$$
$$s = t - \frac{t}{n}$$

If the surrounding is not air, but some other material, then the normal shift is,
$$s = t - \frac{t}{n_{g} /n_{s}}$$
(just divide the n of glass by the n of surroundings)

If s is negative, it means that the shift is towards the right. 


## Multiple Parallel Slabs
The distance is measured from the last surface which is the surface closest to the observer. 

Actual O is at a distance $t_{1} + t_{2}$ from the surface 2. 

For surface 1, O is object and $I_{1}$ is image. For surface 2, $I_{1}$ is object and $I_{2}$ is image. And the final image is $I_{2}$. 

$$d_{i} = \frac{ t_{1} }{ n_{1} /n_{o} } + \frac{ t_{2} }{ n_{2} /n_{o} }$$

For 3 slabs,
$$d_{i} = \frac{ t_{1} }{ n_{1} /n_{o} } + \frac{ t_{2} }{ n_{2} /n_{o} } + \frac{ t_{3} }{ n_{3} /n_{o} }$$
