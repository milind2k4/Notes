# Displacement Method
It is an experimental setup, to find the focal length of converging lens. As only converging lens makes real image of real object.  

A lens is moved starting from near the object towards the screen, there are two points where the image formed by the lens on the screen is sharp. For the fist time, the image formed is big and the second time it is small. 

However, if we keep the object and screen too close (closer than 4f), there will not be any point where there is a sharp image on the screen. 

Using Lens formula,
$$
\begin{split}
\frac{ 1 }{ y } + \frac{1}{x} &= \frac{1}{f} \\
f &= \frac{ xy }{ x+y } \\
\\
\text{Now,} &\\
x + y &= D \\
y - x &= d \\
y &= \frac{ D+d }{ 2 } \\
x &= \frac{ D-d }{ 2 } \\
\\
\text{Thus, focal length,} &\\
f &= \frac{ \frac{ D-d }{ 2 } \times \frac{ D+d }{ 2 } }{ D }
\end{split}
$$

Thus the focal length is,
$$f = \frac{ D^{2}-d^{2} }{ 4D }$$
where,
$D \to$ separation between fixed object and fixed screen
$d \to$ displacement or lens/separation between the two positions

For the first time, $u = -x, v = y$ and thus, $\displaystyle h_{i} = \frac{ -y }{ x }h_{o}$

For the second time, $u = -y, v = x$ and thus, $\displaystyle h_{i} = \frac{ x }{ -y }h_{o}$

If for the first time the image is formed of $mh$ height, the second time it will be formed of $\displaystyle \frac{ h }{ m }$ height. Thus, the geometric mean of their heights will be the height of the object.

$$h_{o}^{2} = h_{1}h_{2}$$
