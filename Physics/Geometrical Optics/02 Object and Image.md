# Object and Image

### Object
The point of intersection of the incident rays.

### Image
The point of intersection of the [[01 Reflection of Light|reflected rays]].

(when image is real then object is virtual, and vice-versa, and they will be on opposite sides of the mirror)


## Point Object
![[object and image plane mirror.png]]

$\triangle \text{ONM}\ \&\ \triangle \text{ONM}$ are congruent. 
$\therefore \ d_{o} = d_{i}.$
And $\because \angle \text{NMI} = \displaystyle \frac{\pi}{2},$ the mirror is the perpendicular bisector of the line joining the object and image.

If mirror is displaced x length, then the image is displaced 2x length. 

## Field of View (FOV)
- Region in which if the observer is present, can observe the image.
- The region consisting of all the reflected rays.

For a man of $H$ height to see his full body in the plane mirror, the mirror needs to be $\displaystyle \frac{H}{2}$ tall.
