# Reflection of Light

If a ray strikes a surface and returns back to the same medium , this phenomenon is known as Reflection. 
- $i$ is the angle of incidence.
- $r$ is the angle of reflection.
- $\delta$ is the deviation.

### Laws of Reflection
1. Incident Ray, Normal and Reflected ray all must lie in the same plane (co-planar).
   Mathematically,
	- Let incident ray be $\vec{I}$, reflected ray be $\vec{R}$, and normal be $\vec{N}$
	  then, *$(\vec{I} \times \vec{R}) \cdot \vec{N} = 0$*
	  (this is called [[05 Scalar Triple Product|Box Product]])
2. Angle of Reflection = Angle of Incidence
   $$\angle r = \angle i$$

Deviation, $\delta = \pi - 2i$:

## Special Cases of Reflection
### Normal Incidence
- $i =r =0^\circ$
- In this case, the light ray **Retraces it's Path** back
- Deviation $\delta = \pi$

- In case of Spherical Mirror:
	- Concave:

	- Convex:

#### Principle of Reversibility
When a ray of light hits a mirror normally (i.e. $i = 0^\circ$), it suffers a deviation of $180^\circ$ and retraces it's path back.

### Grazing Incidence. 
Grazing means to *just* touch
**Only in the case of Convex Mirror.**
- $i =r =90^\circ$
- In this case, the light "Just continues on it's path "
- Deviation $\delta = 0$

## Curve b/w $\delta\ \&\ i$
$$\delta = \pi -2i$$

## Plane Mirror
A thin glass slab with one side polished with silver or aluminium or their compounds. 

The polished side is called the dark side.   

## Ray Tracing 
for paraxial rays

1. If incident ray strikes the mirror parallel to the principal axis it passes thorough the principal focus.

2. If an incident ray passes thorough principal focus, then after reflection it will become parallel to Principal axis

3. If incident ray passes through $C$ then it will strike the mirror normally and retrace it's path back.
