# Spherical Mirror

![[Spherical Mirror Terms.jpg]]

- **Concave**
  ![[Concave MIrror.png]]
	- Converging mirror
	- Reflecting side away from the centre

- **Convex**
	![[Convex-Mirror.png]]
	- Diverging mirror
	- Polished side towards the centre

- Any ray striking parallel to the principal axis will pass thorough a point $\displaystyle \frac{R}{2\cos i}$ distance away from $C$.

#### Centre of Curvature
- $C$ is the centre of the hollow sphere from which mirror is cut.
	- In concave, $C$  is towards the reflecting side
	- In convex, $C$ is towards the polished side
- Any ray passing through $C$ will always strike normally on the mirror.

#### Radius of Curvature
- Radius of hollow sphere from which the mirror is cut.
- The distance between $C$ and the mirror.

#### Pole
$P$ is the point on the surface of mirror about which the co-ordinates of [[02 Object and Image|object and image]] can be written easily. Generally it is the mid point of the mirror.

#### Principal Axis (Optical Axis)
- Line joining $P$ and $C$.
- It is always normal to the mirror. 

#### Aperture Diameter
Diameter of portion of mirror surface which is available for [[01 Reflection of Light|reflection]]. The higher it is the more are is available for reflection. 
- The smaller the aperture, the sharper is the image.

### Focus
##### Principal Focus
*only for Paraxial rays*

It is a point at which reflected rays converge or seem to diverge from in a spherical mirror if incident paraxial rays are parallel to principal focus. It is equidistant from both the centre of curvature and the pole.

Focal length,
> $$f = \frac{R}{2}$$

- **Real Focus, Converging Mirror**

- **Virtual Focus, Diverging Mirror**

##### Other Foci
When the paraxial rays are parallel to each other but not parallel to the principal axis, they meet at a point which is not the principal focus. There are an infinite number of foci.

#### Focal Plane

- $\perp$ principal axis.
- $\displaystyle \frac{R}{2}$ distance away from the [[03 Spherical Mirror#Centre of Curvature|Centre of Curvature]]
- It contains all the foci of a mirror
- The intersection of principal axis and focal plane is the principal focus.

## Sign Convention
1. Pole is origin.
2. Principal Axis will be the x-axis.
3. Direction of incident ray is taken as the +ve x-axis.
   
   ![[Pasted image 20230507120140.png]]
   

4. +ve y-axis is above, -ve y-axis  is below the principal axis.
5. **For convex, $f$ is +ve, and for concave mirror, $f$ is -ve.** 

## Position of Object and Mirror
### Positions and Magnifications of Object and Image in Concave mirror
- O between $C\ \&\ \infty \implies$ I between $C\ \&\ F$, diminished & real 
	- O at $C\ \implies$ I at $C$, of equal size & real
	- O at $\infty\ \implies$ I at $F$, point sized & real

- O between $C\ \&\ F \implies$ I between $C\ \&\ \infty$, enlarged & real
	- O at $F\ \implies$ I at $\infty$, enlarged & real

- O between $F\ \&\ P \implies$ I behind the mirror, enlarged & virtual
	- O at $P \implies$ I at $P$, same size & virtual

### Positions and Magnifications of Object and Image in Convex mirror
- O between $P\ \&\ \infty \implies$ I between $P\ \&\ F$, diminished & virtual  

	- O at $P\ \implies$ I at $P$, of equal size & virtual 
	- O at $\infty\ \implies$ I at $F$, point sized & virtual 

#### Things to note
- Object and Image have $v$ in opposite directions.
- Object or Image - the farther the larger the faster. 
- Concave mirrors are used as shaving mirrors and by dentists.
- Convex mirrors are used as rear view mirrors in vehicles.
	- Convex mirrors have larger [[02 Object and Image#Field of View|FOV]].
