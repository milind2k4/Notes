# Prism
Two flat surfaces between which there is a transparent medium. The angle between the two flat surfaces is called **Angle of Prism** or **Angle of Refraction** or **Refracting Angle** or **Apex Angle.**
$n_{s}$ is the refractive index of surrounding and $n_{p}$ is that of the prism. 

$$r_{1} + r_{2} = A$$
Total deviation,
$$\delta_{net} = \delta_{1} + \delta_{2}$$
$$\delta_{net} = i - r_{1} + e - r_{2}$$
$$\delta_{net} = i + e - A$$

### Deviation
Every deviation other than minimum deviation occurs for 2 angles of incidences. If we exchange i and e, the deviation is the same.

#### Minimum Deviation
It is possible at only one angle of incidence. 

For minimum deviation, $i = e$, and thus, $\delta_{1} = \delta_{2}$. And $r_{1}, r_{2}$ should also be the same.
Therefore,
$$r_{1} = r_{2} = \frac{ A }{ 2 }$$

Using Snell's Law,
$$n_{s}\sin i = n_{p} \sin \frac{A}{2}$$

Therefore, for an equilateral prism, for minimum deviation,
$$A = 60, i = 60, \delta_{m} = 60$$

Now,
$$
\begin{split}
\delta_{m} &= 2i + A\\
i &= \frac{ \delta_{m} + A }{ 2 } \\ \\
\end{split}
$$
Using this we can find relative n for the prism,
$$
\begin{split}
n_{s} \sin \frac{ \delta_{m} + A }{ 2 } &= n_{p} \sin \frac{A}{2} \\ 
n_{rel} = \frac{ n_{p} }{ n_{s} } &= \frac{ \sin \frac{ \delta_{m} + A }{ 2 } }{ \sin \frac{A}{2} }
\end{split}
$$

#### Small Angled Prism 
Where, $(A \leq 8^{\circ})$

$$
\begin{split}
n_{s} \sin i &= n_{p} \sin r_{1} \\
n_{s} \sin e &= n_{p} \sin r_{2} \\
\\
\text{Since the angles are small,} & \\
n_{s} i &= n_{p} r_{1} \\
n_{s} 2 &= n_{p} r_{2} \\
\\
\text{Adding them,} & \\
n_{s} (i + e) &= n_{p}(r_{1} + r_{2}) \\
n_{s} (i + e) &= n_{p} A \\
\end{split}
$$
Thus,
$$\delta = \left( \frac{ n_{p} }{ n_{s} } - 1 \right)A$$
if surrounding is air, then,
$$\delta = (n_{p}-1) A$$

#### Maximum Deviation (only Refraction)
There is refraction at both the surfaces. No [[12 TIR and Critical Angle|TIR.]]

It is possible at two angles of incidence. One of those is when there is grazing incident. The other is when there is grazing emergence.
