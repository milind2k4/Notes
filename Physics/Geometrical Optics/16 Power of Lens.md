# Power of a lens
#important 
$$P = \frac{ 1 }{ f } = \left( \frac{ n_{l} }{ n_{s} } -1 \right)\left( \frac{ 1 }{ R_{1} } - \frac{ 1 }{ R_{2} } \right)$$
$R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ are with sign. 
This is also known as **Lens Maker's Formula.**

In air, focal length of convex lens is +ve while that of concave lens is -ve. The focal length of lens depends on the geometry of the lens and also its relative refractive index. 

If the lens is placed in a medium of same refractive index, its power is zero and focal length infinity. Unless stated, consider lens to be placed in air.  

Unit of Power is $\ce{ m^{-1} }$ which is called *Dioptre (D).*

If in convex lens, $n_{s} > n_{l}$ then the lens acts as diverging lens and has $-ve$ focal length. In convec lens, the R term is +ve.
If in a concave lens, $n_{s} > n_{l}$ then the lens acts as converging lens and has $-ve$ focal length. In concave lens the R term is -ve.

#### Proof
When the lens is placed in a homogeneous medium. I.e. on both sides refractive indices are the same.

Due to refraction by first surface,
$$\frac{ n_{2} }{ v' } - \frac{ n_{1} }{ u } = \frac{ n_{2} - n_{1} }{ R_{1} }$$
where $R_{1}$ is the radius of curvature of the first surface. 

Due to refraction by second surface,
$$\frac{ n_{1} }{ v } - \frac{ n_{2} }{ v' } = \frac{ n_{1}-n_{2} }{ R_{2} }$$
where $R_{2}$ is the radius of curvature of the second surface. 

Adding them,
$$\frac{n_{1}}{v} - \frac{ n_{2} }{ u } = \frac{ n_{2}-n_{1} }{ R_{1} } - \frac{ n_{2}-n_{1} }{ R_{2} }$$
$$\frac{ 1 }{ v } - \frac{ 1 }{ u } = \left( \frac{ n_{2} }{ n_{1} } - 1 \right) \left[ \frac{ 1 }{ R_{1} } - \frac{ 1 }{ R_{2} } \right]$$
When object is at infinity, the image is at focus, thus,
$$\frac{ 1 }{ f } = \left( \frac{ n_{2} }{ n_{1} } - 1 \right) \left[ \frac{ 1 }{ R_{1} } - \frac{ 1 }{ R_{2} } \right]$$
which is the required **Len's Maker's Formula.**

## Lens Formula
It is a relation between the x-coordinates of object and image in case of lens.
(lens is strong so it doesn't need reinforcement and thus there is - in the formula)

$$\frac{ 1 }{ v } - \frac{ 1 }{ u } = \frac{ 1 }{ f }$$
$$v = \frac{ uf }{ u+f }$$

The f of convex is +ve and that of concave is -ve. 

For questions involving multiple reflecting or refracting objects, make sure to draw ray diagrams. Because there might be multiple reflections or refractions. 

In questions where it is asked for distance between lens and mirror, there are two cases. First is when the ray strikes the mirror normally, and  thus retraces it's path. Second is when rays strike the mirror at the pole.

### Graph b/w $v^{-1}$ and $u^{-1}$

![[Converging and Diverging Lens.png]]
(slope of both lines is -1)

From this we can observe that,
1. Graph for converging lens is in 1st, 2nd and 3rd quadrant. 
	- If u is +ve then v can never be -ve simultaneously. 
	  Thus it can never make virtual image of virtual object. 

2. Graph for diverging is in 1st, 3rd and 4th quadrant.
	- If u is -ve, then v can never be +ve simultaneously. 
	  Thus it can never make real image of real object. 

### Graph b/w v and u
Graph is **Rectangular Hyperbola**
