# Telescopes
## Astronomical Telescope
It is made of two converging lenses, objective and eyepiece (ocular). 
The aperture and focal length of the objective should be large, and those of eyepiece should be less. 

In this case, the magnification is defined as,
$$m = \frac{ \beta }{ \alpha }$$
where 
$\alpha \to$ angle subtended by object on eye before using OI
$\beta \to$ angle subtended by object on the eye after using OI

Since we cannot bring an astronomical object at LDCV. 

The objective lens makes the image at the focus as the object is very far away.

#### Normal Adjustment
The image made by the eye piece should be at infinity and thus the image made by the objective should be at the focus of the eye piece. Which is already true as the object is at infinity. 

Thus, length of tube,
> $$l = f_{o} + f_{e}$$

Now, since the angles are small,
$$\alpha = \frac{ A'B' }{ f_{o} }$$
$$\beta = \frac{ A'B' }{ f_{e} }$$

Thus magnification,
> $$m = \frac{ -\beta }{ \alpha } = -\frac{ f_{o} }{ f_{e} }$$
i.e. the image is inverted

Thus the focal length of the objective should be large.

#### Maximum Magnification
The image formed by the eye piece should be at D. 

The image formed by the objective will be at $f_{o}$, and this image should be 
> $$x = \frac{ Df_{e} }{ D + f_{e} }$$
distance from the ocular. 

Thus,  length of tube,
> $$l = f_{o} + \frac{ f_{o}D }{ f_{o} + D }$$ 

Since the angles are small,
$$\alpha = \frac{ A'B' }{ f_{o} }$$
$$\beta = \frac{ A'B'(D + f_{e}) }{ Df_{e} }$$

Now magnification will be,
$$m = \frac{ -\beta }{ \alpha  } = \frac{ -f_{o}(f_{e}+D) }{ f_{e}D }$$

And thus, magnification,
> $$m  = -\frac{ f_{o} }{ f_{e} } \left(  1 + \frac{ f_{e} }{ D } \right)$$
> i.e. the image is inverted.

## Galileo's Telescope 
Combination of converging and diverging lens. The objective lens is converging, but the eyepiece is diverging. 

The formula are all the same as astronomical telescope, just that $f_{e}$ is -ve. 

Due to this, the final image is erect and magnification is thus +ve. 

## Terrestrial Telescope 
Final image will be erect. Thus the magnification is +ve. 
To do this, we use 3 converging lenses. 

We use an extra lens in between the objective and the eyepiece whose magnification is -1, and its role is to just flip the image. 

#### Normal Adjustment
The image formed by the objective is at $f_{o}$. This image should be at $-2f$ distance from the extra lens so that its image is at $+2f$ and is erect. 

Now this 3rd image should be at the 1st focus of the eyepiece. 

Thus, length of tube,
> $$L = f_{o} + 4f + f_{e}$$

The magnification of the final image will be,
> $$m = \frac{ f_{o} }{ f_{e} }$$
i.e. the final image is erect

#### Maximum Magnification 
The eyepiece makes image at D. 

Length of tube,
> $$L = f_{o} + 4f + \frac{ Df_{e} }{ D + f_{e} }$$

Magnification,
> $$m = \frac{ f_{o} }{ f_{e} } \left(  1 + \frac{ f_{e} }{ D } \right)$$
i.e. the image is erect.
