# Human Eye
The lens in the eye can change its focal length using muscles. The radius of the eye is roughly 2.5 cm. 

The image is always formed on the retina, thus v = 2.5.

$$
\begin{split}
\frac{ 1 }{ v } - \frac{ 1 }{ u } &= \frac{ 1 }{ f } \\
\frac{ 1 }{ 2.5 } - \frac{ 1 }{ x } &= \frac{ 1 }{ f } \\
f &= \frac{ 2.5x }{ 2.5 + x }
\end{split}
$$
where x is the position of image. 

We can write this as,
$$f = \frac{ 2.5 }{ \frac{ 2.5 }{ x } - 1 }$$
thus, 
$$x \uparrow \implies f \uparrow \implies P \downarrow$$
$$x \downarrow \implies f \downarrow \implies P \uparrow$$

As the position of object changes, to make image at v = +2.5 cm, the focal length of eye lens changes. This process is known as Accommodation. 

The focal length and power can vary as,
$$2.272 \leq f \leq 2.5$$
$$40 \leq P \leq 44$$
where f is in cm and P in D.

#### Relaxed Eye
When the object is at infinity, the eyes are least stressed. 
"The fat point is at infinity."

In this case, focal length is,
$$f = 2.5 \ce{\ cm }$$
this is the max focal length of eye. 

The power in this case is,
$$P = 40\ \text{D}$$
which is the least.

#### Stressed Eye
When the object is at near point, the eyes are most stressed. 
This is when the object is 25 cm away from eyes. 

This point is called **Least Distance for Clear Vision.**

In this case, focal length is,
$$f = \frac{ 25 }{ 11 } \approx 2.272\ \ce{ cm }$$
this is the least focal length of eye. 

The power in this case is,
$$P = 44 \ce{\ D }$$
which is  the most.

## Defects in Eye

### Myopia (Short-Sightedness)
Far away objects are not clear. The image formed is not on the retina, but a bit before that. Prevalent in young people. 

The far point is not infinity.

To fix this, we use a diverging lens in front of the eye. 

The diverging lens makes the image of infinity at the far point. This image is the object for eyes, and since it is at the far point, its image is formed at the retina. 

The focal length for the diverging lens will be,
$$f = -x$$

### Hypermetropia (Far-Sightedness)
When the nearby objects are not clear. The image formed is not at the retina, but a bit after that. 

Prevalent in middle aged people.

The near point is not 25 cm, but more than that. 

To fix this, we use a converging lens in front of the eye, which converges the rays and makes the image farther than the object. This image is object for eye, and is farther than the near point or at it. 

The focal length of the converging lens used will be,
$$f = \frac{ xD }{ x-D }$$
where,
$x \to$ the near point
$D \to$ the usual near point, 25 cm.

### Presbyopia
Combination of myopia and hypermetropia. 

Prevalent in old people, as the muscles in the eye become weak, and thus cannot change the focus of the eye as well as normal people. 

Far point is less than infinity, and the near point is more than 25 cm. 

To fix a combination of converging and diverging lens is used. 

### Astigmatism
Eye is not perfectly symmetrical. It is slightly distorted. The eye ball has different radius of curvature in perpendicular directions.  Thus, the focal length vertically is not the same as the focal length horizontally. 

There have multiple focal points on the retina.

A perfect grid is not seen perfectly. Some lines are curved.

To fix this we use cylindrical lens which have different radius of curvature.

## Visual Angle
The angle subtended by an object on the eye. The larger it is the larger is the image of the object on our retina. 

$$\theta = \frac{ h }{ x }$$
The maximum value of it will be when the object is 25 cm away from the eye. 
Here, visual angle is,
$$\theta_{o} = \frac{ h }{ D }$$

#### Angular Magnification
The optical instruments we use make the visual angle larger. 

$$m = \frac{ \theta  }{ \theta_{o} }$$
$$m = \frac{ \text{visual angle with instrument} }{ \text{maximum visual angle without instrument} }$$

m should be more than 1, i.e. $\theta > \theta_{o}$, so that the optical instrument is useful.
