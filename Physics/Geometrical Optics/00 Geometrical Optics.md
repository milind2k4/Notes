# Geometrical Optics
**Optics:** Study of Light.

Light behaves like a ray. 

- **Rectilinear propagation of light:**
	- Light will keep on travelling in a straight line in a homogeneous medium until it encounters a hindrance. 
	- The straight line on which light travels is known as "Ray". It is represented by an arrow geometrically. 

- If many rays are shown together it is called a beam.

#### Light
- It is part of [[00 EM Wave|electromagnetic wave]] whose wavelength lies b/w 3600 $\dot{A}$ to 7800 $\dot{A}$ in vacuum/air
- Part of EM wave which is responsible for our vision.
- Although the properties of light are similar to the properties  of all other EM waves.

## Properties of Light
Light is an EM wave.

Speed of Light in air or vacuum: $c = 3 \times 10^{8} m/s$

In any other medium, speed of light $\displaystyle v = \frac{c}{n}$, where n is the refractive index of the medium.
  
$\displaystyle n = \frac{c}{v}$, n is a ratio, which is 1 or more. 
- $\displaystyle n_{water} = \frac{4}{3} \implies v_{water}= \frac{3 \times 10^8}{4/3} .$
- $n_{glass} = 3/2$ 
- $n \geq 1$
- $n_{meta-material} =-ve$

$v = f \lambda$, where $v$ is the speed of light, $f$ is the frequency and $\lambda$ is the wavelength. 

Particle of light is known as "Photon" or "Quanta".
- This photon has momentum $\displaystyle P = \frac{h}{\lambda}$.
- This photon has energy $\displaystyle E = hf = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$, where $h$ is Plank's constant

When light hits an interface, the intensity gets divided,
 ![[properties_reflection_refraction.png]]
 
($f$ is source dependent not medium dependent)
($v$ is medium dependent not source dependent)
($\lambda$ is medium dependent not source dependent)
($v$ & $\lambda$ change with the same fraction as $\displaystyle \lambda =\frac{v}{f} \implies \lambda \propto v$)

## Mirrors Inclined at an Angle
Images are formed on a circle which has the centre at the vertex of the mirrors. And whose radius is the distance of object from the vertex. 

![[Pasted image 20230505121008.png]]

We can count the number of images by, criss-crossing until the angle is less than 180. 

![[Pasted image 20230505121226.png]]

Also, we need to remove an image for overlapping. 
To check overlap check if at the same level, **$M_{1} + M_{2} + \theta = 360$**.

For example, if $\theta = 60$, and $M_{1} = 150 = M_{2}$ at the same horizontal level, then the images will coincide as $150 + 150 + 60 = 360$,

We also have a formula,
- If $360 /\theta$ is even, then
	$$n = \frac{ 360 }{ \theta  } - 1$$

- If $360 /\theta$ is odd, and object is symmetrically placed then,
	$$n = \frac{ 360 }{ \theta  } - 1$$

- If $360 /\theta$ is odd, and object is not symmetrically placed then,
	$$n = \frac{ 360 }{ \theta  }$$

#### Perpendicular Mirrors
Number of images is always 3.

Two images, the images of O in $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ coincide. I.e. $I_{3}$ and $I_{4}$ coincide.

All of the images and the object are the same distance $\sqrt{ x^{2} + y^{2} }$, thus they lie on a circle of the same radius.

#### Parallel mirrors
- no of images $\to \infty$

![[image by 2 parallel mirrors.png]]

The distances from the mirrors form an arithmetic progression
- in terms of distance $x$ from the first mirror

  ![[AP formed by 2 parallel mirrors in terms of x.png]]

- in terms of distance $y$ from the second mirror:

  ![[AP formed by 2 parallel mirrors in terms of y.png]]

This is due to multiple [[01 Reflection of Light|reflections]] 

## Rotation
### Rotation of Incident Ray
![[rotation of incident ray.png]]

### Rotation of Mirror
$\theta_{R}=2\theta _{m} \implies \upomega_R=2\upomega_m$ , where $\upomega$ represents angular velocity.

![[rotation of mirror.png]]


### If both Incident Ray and Mirror are rotating
> $\theta_{R} = 2 \theta_{m} - \theta_I$
> $\upomega_{R} = 2 \upomega_{m} - \upomega_I$

## Velocity of Image
$\parallel$ to Mirror, the Motion of image is the same as Motion of Object.
- $x_{iy}=x_{oy}$
- $v_{iy}=v_{oy}$
- $x_{iz}=x_{oz}$
- $v_{iz}=v_{oz}$

Perpendicular to Mirror however, the Motion of Image is opposite to the Motion of Object. ($_m$ represents w.r.t the mirror)
- $x_{im}=-x_{om}$
- $v_{im}=-v_{om}$
- $a_{im}=-a_{om}$

Thus, perpendicular to the mirror,
- $v_{im}=-v_{om} \implies (v_{i} - v_{m}) = -(v_{o} - v_{m})$
- $v_{i} = 2v_{m} - v_{o}$
- $a_{i} = 2a_{m} - a_{o}$

## Mirror is Cut
![[Mirror is Cut.png]]

The position of image is generally, not changed when mirror is cut, but its intensity is decreased. The pole is also where it originally was.

It is not necessary that the pole is always at the centre of the mirror. It could be anywhere. Also, we can use all the standard formula even when the pole is not at the centre.
