# Thin Lens
#important 
A transparent homogeneous medium enclosed by at least one spherical surface is called **Lens.** 

Equiconvex/concave means that both the surfaces have equal radius of curvature. 

Convex lenses are thick in the middle, aka **Converging Lens.**

Concave lenses are thin in the middle, aka **Diverging Lens**

## Foci of Lens
**2nd Focus:** the point at which parallel paraxial rays meet after refraction. 

**1st Focus:** the point at which if source is kept, after refraction the rays become parallel to principal axis. 

Lens with +ve focal length in air is called **Converging Lens.**
Both foci are principal focus.

Lens with -ve focal length in air is called **Diverging Lens.**
Both foci are called principal focus. And it is the opposite to that of convex lens (i.e. 2nd focus is on the -ve side).

For a parallel beam to emerge parallel again after refraction by 2 lenses, they should be $d$ distance apart where $d$ is,
$$d = f_{1} + f_{2}$$
Here $f_{1},f_{2}$ are with sign. 

And the radius of the final emergent beam is,
$$R_{2} = \frac{ f_{2} }{ f_{1} } R_{1}$$
where $R_{1}$ is the radius of incident beam. 

If $f_{1} < f_{2}$, then the intensity of beam is increased. The power remains the same. 
$$I_{2} = \left( \frac{ R_{1} }{ R_{2} } \right)^{2} I_{1}$$
$$I_{2} = \left( \frac{ f_{1} }{ f_{2} } \right)^{2} I_{1}$$

## Combination of lenses
If both the lenses are very close or are touching each other. 

The image formed by fist lens will act as object for the second lens. 

$$
\begin{split}
\text{Reftaction by lens 1,} \\
\frac{ 1 }{ v_{1} } - \frac{ 1 }{ u } &= \frac{ 1 }{ f_{1} } \\
\\
\text{Refraction by lens 2,} \\
\frac{ 1 }{ v } - \frac{ 1 }{ v_{1} } &= \frac{ 1 }{ f_{2} } \\
\\
\text{Thus final image,} \\
\frac{ 1 }{ v } - \frac{ 1 }{ u } &= \frac{1}{f_{1}} + \frac{ 1 }{ f_{2} } \\
\frac{ 1 }{ v } - \frac{ 1 }{ u } &= \frac{ 1 }{ f_{eq} } \\
\end{split}
$$

Where,
$$\frac{1}{f_{eq}} = \frac{ 1 }{ f_{1} } + \frac{ 1 }{ f_{2} }$$

We can also say, in terms of power,
$$P_{eq} = P_{1} + P_{2}$$

Magnification of the system is,
$$m_{\text{total}} = m_{1}.m_{2}.m_{3}. \dots $$
This works even if the lenses are not touching each other.

If the lenses are separated by a distance d, the equivalent focal length of the configuration is,
$$\frac{ 1 }{ f_{eq} } = \frac{ 1 }{ f_{1} } + \frac{ 1 }{ f_{2} } - \frac{ d }{ f_{1}f_{2} }$$
here $f_{1},f_{2}$ are with sign. 

However, this $f_{eq}$ has no physical significance. I.e. we cannot put this into the lens formula. This formula is only applied when only the focal length is asked.

## Deviation by Lens

For paraxial rays,
$$
\begin{split}
\delta &= \alpha + \beta \\
&= \frac{ h }{ OP } + \frac{ h }{ IP } \\
\delta &= h\left( \frac{ 1 }{ -u } + \frac{ 1 }{ v } \right) \\
\delta &= \frac{ h }{ f }
\end{split}
$$

Thus, deviation,
$$\delta = \frac{ h }{ f }$$
where h is the distance from pole where ray strikes.

## Combination of Lens and Mirror
When the lens and mirror are touching or very close.

We don't change the sign for the 2nd refraction. Due to this, for the 2nd refraction, we write $-f_{l}$ instead of $f_{l}$.

$$
\begin{split}
\text{Refraction by lens,} \\
\frac{ 1 }{ v_{1} } - \frac{ 1 }{ u } &= \frac{ 1 }{ f_{l} } \\
\\
\text{Reflection by mirror,} \\
\frac{ 1 }{ v_{2} } + \frac{ 1 }{ v_{1} } &= \frac{ 1 }{ f_{m} } \\
\\
\text{Refraction by lens,} \\
\frac{ 1 }{ v } - \frac{ 1 }{ v_{2} } &= \frac{ 1 }{ -f_{l} } \\
\\
\text{(2) + (3) - (1)} \\
\frac{ 1 }{ v } + \frac{ 1 }{ u } &= \frac{ 1 }{ f_{m} } - \frac{ 1 }{ f_{l} } - \frac{ 1 }{ f_{l} }
\end{split}
$$

Thus,
$$\frac{ 1 }{ v } = \frac{ 1 }{ f_{m} } - \frac{ 2 }{ f_{l} }$$
From here we can observe that the final combination will act like a spherical mirror. Physically it means that the rays cannot cross the arrangement. 

The equivalent focal length of the corresponding mirror will be,
$$\frac{ 1 }{ f_{eq} } = \frac{ 1 }{ f_{m} } - \frac{ 2 }{ f_{l} }$$
