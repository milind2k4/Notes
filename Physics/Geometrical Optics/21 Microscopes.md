# Microscopes
## Simple Microscope
A single Converging lens. The smaller the focal length, the better. 

The visual angle without the instrument,
> $$\theta_{o} = \frac{ h }{ D }$$

With the instrument, the visual angle is,
> $$\theta = \frac{ h }{ x }$$

The magnification is,
> $$m = \frac{ \theta  }{ \theta_{o} } = \frac{ D }{ x }$$

If nothing is said about normal or maximum magnification, take the case for normal adjustment. 
#### Normal Adjustment
Adjustment such that the eyes are relaxed. For our eyes, it is when the object is at infinity. 

Thus the object should be at the 1st focus of the lens. 

Thus, the visual angle is,
$$\theta = \frac{ h }{ f }$$

And magnification,
$$m = \frac{ \theta  }{ \theta_{o} } =\frac{ h / f }{ h / D } = \frac{ D }{ f }$$
Thus,
> $$m = \frac{ D }{ f }$$

Since $m \propto 1 /f$, the focal length should be as less as possible. And since we want to see the image bigger, f should not be 25 cm or more.

#### Maximum magnification
We bring the object closer to the lens, the image also comes closer to out eyes. If we bring the object too close, the image of it formed by the lens will be closer than LDCV and thus will not be clear. 

The eyes in this case are most stressed. 

The image is D distance from the lens (lens are eye are very close).

Using lens formula,
$$\frac{ 1 }{ -D } + \frac{ 1 }{ x } = \frac{ 1 }{ f }$$
> $$x = \frac{ fD }{ f+D }$$

Now, the visual angle,
$$\theta = \frac{ h }{ x } = \frac{ h(f+D) }{ fD }$$

The magnification,
$$m = \frac{ \theta  }{ \theta_{o} } = \frac{ h(f+D) }{ fD \displaystyle \cdot \frac{ h }{ D } }$$
> $$m_{max} = 1 + \frac{ D }{ f }$$

## Compound Microscope
Combination of two simple microscopes. One lens is near the object called **Objective**, the other is near the eye called **Eye Piece (Ocular)**. 

The aperture and focal length of the objective should be less, and the focal length and aperture of the eye piece should be more.  

The $L$ is the distance between the lenses and it can be varied. 

The net magnification is,
> $$m = m_{o}m_{e} = m_{t}m_{\theta}$$
> the $m_{t}$ is the transverse magnification for the objective and $m_{\theta}$ is the angular magnification for the eyepiece.

#### Normal Adjustment
When the image is formed at infinity. For this the image formed by the objective should be at the focus of the eye piece. 

The magnification for the eye piece is the same as normal adjustment for simple microscope. 

The image formed by the objective will be at,
$$v_{o} = \frac{ f_{o}u_{o} }{ u_{o}-f_{o} }$$

In this case,  the length of the tube is,
> $$l = \frac{ f_{o}u_{o} }{ u_{o} - f_{o} } + f_{e}$$

And magnification,
$$m = \frac{ \theta  }{ \theta_{o} } = \frac{ h' / f_{e} }{ h / D } = \frac{ h' }{ h } \frac{ D }{ f_{e} }$$

Using transverse magnification for objective,
$$m_{t} = \frac{ h' }{ h } = \frac{ f_{o} }{ f_{o} - u_{o} }$$

Thus, the magnification,
$$m = \frac{ f_{o} }{ f_{o}- u_{o} } \frac{ D }{ f_{e} }$$

Again, using $m = m_{1}m_{2} = m_{t}m_{\theta}$,
$$m_{t} = \frac{ f_{o} }{ f_{o} - u_{o} }$$
$$m_{\theta} = \frac{ D }{ f_{e} }$$

Net magnification,
> $$m = \left( \frac{ f_{o} }{ u_{o} - f_{o} } \right) \frac{ D }{ f_{e} }$$

#### Maximum Magnification
The image formed by the objective is at,
> $$v_{o} = \frac{ f_{o}u_{o} }{ u_{o}-f_{o} }$$

This image will be x away from the eyepiece where x is,
> $$x = \frac{ f_{e}D }{ f_{e}+D }$$


Thus, length of tube,
> $$l = \frac{ f_{o}u_{o} }{ u_{o}-f_{o} } + \frac{ f_{e}D }{ f_{e} + D }$$

Magnification,
$$m = \frac{ \theta  }{ \theta_{o} } = \frac{ h' /x }{ h /D } = \frac{ h' }{ h } \frac{ D }{ x }$$

We can also use $m = m_{t}m_{\theta}$.

Thus, magnification,
> $$m = \frac{ f_{o} }{ u_{o}-f_{o} }\left( 1 + \frac{ D }{ f_{e} } \right)$$
