# Image formation by Refraction
## Through plane surface
1. Object and image will be on the same side of the interface.
2. If object is real then image is virtual and vice versa. 

### Normal Incident: No deviation $\delta = 0$

### Denser to Rarer: Deviation away from normal

### For two media

$$d_{i} = \frac{ t_{1} }{ n_{1} / n_{o} } + \frac{ t_{2} }{ n_{2} / n_{o} }$$

Similarly for more than two mediums. 

## Composite Slab
Using Snell's law at every interface,
$$n_{1}\sin i_{1} = n_{2}\sin i_{2}$$
$$n_{2}\sin i_{2} = n_{3}\sin i_{3}$$
$$n_{3}\sin i_{3} = n_{4}\sin i_{4}$$

Thus,
$$n_{1}\sin i_{1} = n_{4}\sin i_{4}$$
i.e. values of $n_{2}, n_{3}$ are not required. 

This only works if there is no [[12 TIR and Critical Angle|TIR.]]

In questions where the refractive index is a function of y, as we have to find the equation of path of ray of light, first we draw a horizontal line. At every point on this line, the refractive index is the same. 

Then we use the concept of composite slab and find the angle of incident on that horizontal line. 

We then find the slope at that point, and express it in terms of y. Then integrate for final equation.
