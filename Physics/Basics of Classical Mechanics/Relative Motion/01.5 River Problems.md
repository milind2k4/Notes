# River Problems
The velocity of person in the river is the velocity wrt ground. The velocity of man in still water is the relative velocity of man with river. 

$$\vec{v}_{m} = \vec{v}_{mr} + \vec{v}_{r}$$

### In 1D
Swimming along the river is called swimming Downstream, and swimming against it is called swimming upstream. 

## In 2D

$v_{r}$ is the velocity of river
$v_{m}$ is the velocity of man

### Time Taken
$$T = \frac{W}{v_{mr} \sin \theta}$$

### Minimum Time to Cross the River
When $\theta = 90$. I.e. we swim along y-axis. 
In this case, net velocity of man $= \sqrt{v_{mr}^{2} + v_{r}^{2}}$

In this case, 
$$T = \frac{W}{v_{mr}}$$
$$x = \frac{v_{r}W}{v_{mr}}$$

### Drift
By the time man crosses the river, he will have some displacement along x-axis. This displacement is called drift.

$$x = (v_{mr} \cos \theta + v_{r}) \frac{W}{v_{mr} \sin \theta}$$

#### Zero Drift
Zero drift means that the displacement is width of river. To reach the other bank just opposite, the man will have to swim at an angle, against the downstream. 

This can only happen if $v_{mr}$ is more than $v_{r}$. 

$$v_{mr}\cos \theta = v_{r}$$

![[Drift = 0.png]]

In this case, time taken to cross the river,
$$T = \frac{ W }{ \sqrt{ v_{m} } } = \frac{ W }{ \sqrt{ v_{mr}^{2} - v_{r}^{2} } }$$

#### Minimum Drift
When the velocity of river is more than the velocity of man w.r.t river.

In this case, the net velocity along x-axis will be $v_{r} - v_{mr}\cos \theta$

$$
\begin{split}
x &= v_{x}t \\
&= (v_{r}- v_{mr}\cos \theta) \frac{ W }{ v_{mr}\sin \theta} \\
&= W \left( \frac{ v_{r} }{ v_{mr} } \csc \theta - \cot \theta \right)
\end{split}
$$

It will be minimum when,
$$\cos \theta = \frac{ v_{mr} }{ v_{r} }$$
