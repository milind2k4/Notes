# Types of Questions
### Lifts
If an object is released when lift is going up,
$a_{f} = g + a$
You feel heavier when the lift is going up.

If an object is released when lift is going down,
$a_{f} = g - a$
You feel lighter when the lift is going down.  

### Fluttering of Flag
If flag is at rest, it will flutter in the direction of the wind. 

If there is no wind, the flag will flutter in the direction opposite to its velocity. 
 
Flag will flutter in the direction of velocity of wind w.r.t flag. i.e. $\vec{v}_{wf} = \vec{v}_{w} - \vec{v}_{f}$.

### Velocity wrt Ground
The relative velocity is given, we have to find the net velocity with respect to the ground.

$$\vec{v}_{a} = \vec{v}_{ab} + \vec{v}_{b}$$

### Projection from Moving Cart
Cart is also called platform

Use the previous concept of velocity w.r.t ground to find velocity of ball.

### Muzzle Speed of Bullet
The muzzle speed of a bullet is the speed of bullet w.r.t the gun. Thus, if the gun is also moving, the muzzle speed of bullet is the velocity w.r.t the moving gun not w.r.t the ground. 

To find the velocity of bullet w.r.t ground, we add the velocity of gun to the muzzle speed of bullet.

### Velocity of Separation/Approach

When the distance between two points is increasing or decreasing.   

$$v_{s/a} = \frac{ds}{dt}$$

If they are approaching, then $v_{s/a}$ is -ve. If they are separating then it is +ve.

It is the component of relative velocity which is along the line connecting two points. 

Make a line joining A and B and then find the components of velocity along that line. 

#### Condition for Collision
The objects will collide only when the perpendicular components of the velocities are the same. 

$$v_{a}\sin \theta_{a} = v_{b}\sin \theta_{b}$$

Time to collide,
$$T = \frac{ r }{ v_{b}\cos \theta_{b} + v_{a}\cos \theta_{a} }= \frac{ r }{ v_{app} }$$

If the velocity of approach is constant, then $v_{app} \times t$ is equal to the separation decreased. 

If it is not constant, separation decreased,
$$S = \int v_{app} \, dt $$

#### Minimum Separation
When velocity of approach or separation is zero, the separation is minimum. In this case, all the velocity is perpendicular to the line joining the 2 points. 

It is when the relative velocity between the bodies is perpendicular to the line joining them.

We can do these kinds of question in two ways,
one is where we find the separation between the points in terms of time, then differentiate it and find the minima. 

Or, find relartive velocity, then draw a line along this, then drop a perpendicular on this line from the point and find it's length. 

Example,

Example when both of them are moving towards the same point,
![[Pasted image 20230502123925.png]]

In these questions, alternatively,
- find which one reaches the origin first and find the time it takes
- draw diagram at that time
- solve like the previous question
- be careful in calculating the time of min separation, make sure to add the previous calculated time in the first step

### Wind Problem
It is mathematically the same as River Problems. Instead of water currents, here we have air currents.

### Rain Problem
$v_{r}$ is velocity of rain
$v_{m}$ is velocity of man
$v_{rm}$ is velocity of rain w.r.t man

This $v_{rm}$ is the velocity of rain as seen by the man. 

Break the velocity of rain into it's components and then solve.

In some questions if angle from the vertical is given and  nothing else is said, then we have to consider the angle in both directions, clockwise and anticlockwise from the vertical.  

### Perfectly Symmetrical Motion
When the motion of one body is directed towards another which is directed towards the next and so on until we reach the first one. The bodies are on a regular polygon's vertices. And they have the same speed which is constant throughout the motion.

At any time, the shape formed by connecting the bodies will be the same, but smaller than the shape they were originally on. 

They will meet simultaneously and at a point which is the most symmetric to all of them. I.e. the centre of the shape. The displacement will be the same for all the bodies. 

The bodies will move on a curve. 

To find when they will meet, find the velocity of approach of any two. Then divide the original separation with this velocity, as this separation becomes zero, so the change is separation is this length.

To find the distance travelled, multiply the speed with the time taken. Because the speed of particle is constant.
