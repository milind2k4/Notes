# CM in Vertical Plane
[[00 Dynamics]] and [[03 Energy#Total Mechanical Energy Conservation Theorem]] are extensively used here. 

Since tension and velocity are perpendicular to each other, the work done and power by it are zero. Thus we can apply TMEC on any two points.

Radial force.
$$T - mg\cos \theta = \frac{ mv^{2} }{ l }$$

Tangential force,
$$T = mg\sin \theta = ma_{t}$$
$$a_{t} = g\sin \theta$$

### Complete Vertical CM
#### Restrained 
When the particle cannot leave the circular path. 

The tension or normal adjusts itself such that the particle does not leave the circle.

Applying TMEC on the top and bottom of the circle,
$$0 + \frac{1}{2}mv_{min}^{2} = 2gmR + 0$$
We get,
$$u_{min} = \sqrt{ 4gR }$$
This is the min velocity required to complete full CM. 

At the top of the circle, the velocity becomes zero. 

To find tension/normal at any point, we use NLM. 

At $\cos ^{-1} \frac{ -2 }{ 3 }$, the tension becomes zero, and after that it becomes -ve and thus pushes. 

In the case of tube, until $\cos ^{-1} \frac{ -2 }{ 3 }$, the outer surface pushes inwards and after that the inner surfaces pushes outwards.

#### Unrestricted 
When the particle can leave the circular path. It can come inside the circle.

Tension has the least value at the top, which should be just greater than zero,
$$
\begin{split}
T + mg &= m \frac{ v_{min}^{2} }{ R }\\
0 + mg &= m \frac{ v_{min}^{2} }{ R } \\
v_{min} &= \sqrt{ gR }
\end{split}
$$
For one instant at the top, the tension will be zero but since at this point it has velocity, the particle does not leave the circular path. 

Now, applying TMEC on the top and bottom points,
$$\frac{ 1 }{ 2 } m u_{min}^{2} + 0 = \frac{1}{2}mv_{min}^{2} + 2gR$$
Giving,
$$u_{min} = \sqrt{ 5gR }$$
Which is the least velocity required to complete circular motion. 

Also,
$$T_\text{bottom} - T_\text{top} = 6mg$$
$$N_\text{bottom} - N_\text{top} = 6mg$$
And, the difference between any two consecutive 90 degrees is 3mg.

If the tension or normal becomes zero, the particle starts doing parabolic motion. 

Example on this,

This can also be done alternatively by considering an inclined plane.
