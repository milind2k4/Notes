# Two Block Problems
1. Assume that the two blocks on top of each other move together.
2. Find acceleration using this assumption, i.e. take both blocks as system. 
3. Find frictional force.
4. If $f < f_{s(max)}$ then our assumption is correct and the blocks move together. 
4. If $f > f_{s(max)}$ then our assumption is incorrect and the blocks move separately.  

If blocks move together,

If blocks move separately,

When force is applied on the top block and the blocks do not move together,

When force is applied on both the blocks,

## Three Block Problem
Similar to two block problem. Follow all the same steps by assuming the top two blocks as one block.
