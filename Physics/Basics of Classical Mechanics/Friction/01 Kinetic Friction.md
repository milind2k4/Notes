# Kinetic Friction
Kinetic Friction always opposes the relative motion of between surface and tries to make relative $v$ between them 0. Thus it's direction is opposite to the relative motion.

### Magnitude
$$f_{k}= \mu _{k}N$$
where,
$f_{k} \to$ magnitude of Kinetic Friction,
$\mu_{k} \to$ coefficient of Kinetic Friction,
$N \to$ Normal.  

$\mu_{k}$ depends on nature of surfaces, i.e. if the surfaces are smooth, $\mu_{k} = 0$ 

The net contact force is,
$$R = N\sqrt{ 1 + \mu_{k}^{2} }$$

giving angle of friction,
$$\tan \phi = \frac{ \mu_{k}N }{ N } = \mu_{k}$$

For a body on the ground,
$$f_{k} = \mu_{k}\ mg $$

### Coefficient of Kinetic Friction

1. $0 \leq \mu \leq \infty$ (if zero then the surface is smooth)
2. Does not depend on the normal reaction.
3. Does not depend on area of contact.
4. Does not depend upon the relative motion between surfaces.
5. Depends on the roughness and material of surface. 

### Examples

If there are two blocks initially in contact on an incline and their masses or $\mu_{k}$ or both are different, then they need not be in contact the whole journey down the incline. They might get separated also. 

If the difference $mg\sin \theta - f_{k}$ of the lower block is more than that of the upper block then the blocks will move apart.

If the difference is less than the upper block however, the blocks move while in contact and thus the acceleration of both becomes equal.

Since both move while in contact, we can apply NLM on the system of both of them also,
