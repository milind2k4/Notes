# Static Friction

Static friction acts between two contact surfaces when there is no relative velocity but they have a tendency of it.
It opposes relative motion. 

It is a self adjusting force, it can change its direction and magnitude.
It can vary its magnitude but it cannot cross a maximum limit known as limiting friction. 


## Magnitude of Static Friction

$$0 \leq f_{s} \leq f_{s(max)}$$
$$f_{s(max)} = \mu _{s}N$$

where,
$f_{s} \to$ magnitude of Static Friction,
$\mu_{s} \to$ coefficient of Static Friction,
$N$ is the normal. 

$\mu _{s}$ depends on surfaces in contact, the more rough they are, the more it is and it is slightly greater than $\mu _{k}$.

Until and unless stated, we take the value of $\mu_{k}$ and $\mu_{s}$ the same, i.e. $\mu_{k} = \mu_{s}$. 

If force is zero $f_{s}=0$.
When force is less than or equal to $f_{s}(max)$, $f_{s}$ is equal but opposite in direction to the force applied.

When the force is more than $f_{s}(max)$, the body starts moving. And frictional force will be $f_{k}$. 

## Pushing and Pulling

#### Pushing is Easier than Pulling
When we push a block smaller than ourselves, a force is applied in the vertical direction due to which the normal and thus the static friction is increased. 

When we pull, the force in the vertical direction is along the normal, which thus decreases the normal and in turn the static friction.

### Min. force required to Pull
It is when the force is equal to the limiting frictional force.

If the angle is fixed,
$$
\begin{split}
N &= (mg - F\sin \theta) \\
F\cos \theta &= \mu N\\
&= \mu (mg - F\sin \theta) \\
\\
F &= \frac{ \mu mg }{ \cos \theta + \mu \sin \theta }
\end{split}
$$

At some angle the force will be minimum, and the denominator, $\cos \theta + \mu \sin \theta$ will be maximum. 
$$
\begin{split}
f(\theta) &= \cos \theta + \mu \sin \theta \\
f'(\theta) &= -\sin \theta + \mu \cos \theta = 0 \\
\tan \theta &= \mu \\
\\
\theta &= \tan ^{-1}\mu
\end{split}
$$

The value of $f(\theta)$ at this $\theta$ can be found using triangle, and comes out to be,
$$f(\tan ^{-1}\mu) = \sqrt{ 1 + \mu^{2} }$$

Thus, the minimum value of force will be,
$$F = \frac{ \mu mg }{ \sqrt{ 1+\mu^{2} } }$$

### Friction along with another Force

If more than one force can balance the applied force, and one of them is friction, then as we slowly increase the applied force, only the friction will balance it at first. Then when the friction will reach it's max. value, the other forces will balance it. 

In the following situations, if force is less than the limiting friction, frictional force alone will balance it.

When dealing with two blocks, start with the block on which more force is applied.
