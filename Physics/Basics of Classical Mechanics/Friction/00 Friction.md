# Friction
It is an electromagnetic force contact force which acts along common surface of objects in contact. 

It opposes relative or tendency of it between the objects in contact.

The **Angle of Friction** is the angle *between the Normal and the net Reaction Froce.*
$$\tan \phi = \frac{ f }{ N }$$
$$\cos \phi = \frac{ N }{ R }$$

The net contact force is,
$$R = \sqrt{ N^{2} + f^{2} }$$

Reasons for friction,
1. The intermolecular forces between the surfaces in contact.

1. The roughness of the surfaces in contact which cause interlocking and thus resist the relative motion.

## Types of Friction
- [[01 Kinetic Friction]]: When there is relative motion between contact surfaces. Represented by $f_{k}$. It is a fixed value.
- [[02 Static Friction]]: When there is tendency of relative motion. Represented by $f_{s}$. It's not a fixed value. The maximum value of it is called **Limiting Friction** i.e. $f_{s(max)}$



### Some things to note
1. If $\mu _{k}\ \&\ \mu_{s}$ are not given separately, take them to be the same. 
2. Thus, take $f_{k} = f_{s}(max)$ if nothing is said. 
3. If we have a situation where there are 2 blocks connected and there is force on both  the blocks outwards, start writing the forces from the larger force. 

## Angle of Repose
The angle of inclined plane at which the block just starts slipping. 

$$mg \sin \theta_{r} = \mu _{s}\ mg\cos \theta_{r}$$
$$\tan \theta_{r} = \mu _{s}$$

When $\theta < \theta_{r}$, the block is at rest. When $\theta = \theta_{r}$ the blocks just starts slipping, and when $\theta > \theta_{r}$ the block will slip down the incline. 

This property can be used to find the coefficient of friction between two surfaces. However it tells the static friction.
