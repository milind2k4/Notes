# Projectile Motion
Also known as **Planar Motion.**

### Galileo's Statement
*Motion in mutually perpendicular directions are independent of each other.*

Thus, we can separate motion in 2D into two 1D components, which do not affect each other.

That is we can differentiate $x$ position to get $v_{x}$ and differentiate again to get $a_{x}$. Same for $y$ position. 

Then to find the net velocity, $v = v_{x} \hat{i} + v_{y} \hat{j}$.
Then to find the net acceleration, $a = a_{x} \hat{i} + a_{y} \hat{j}$.

To find the angle between the velocity vector and acceleration vector, we can use the [[04 Dot Product|dot product]]. 

$$\cos \theta = \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{a}}{|\vec{v}||\vec{a}|}$$

One thing to note is,
$$
\begin{split}
\int d\vec{s} &= \text{displacement} \\
\int ds &= \text{path length}
\end{split}
$$
