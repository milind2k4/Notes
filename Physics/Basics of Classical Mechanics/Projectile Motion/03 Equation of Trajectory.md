# Equation of Trajectory
An equation between $x,y$ is called Equation of trajectory.

### Finding Equation of Motion
The x-coordinate and y-coordinates will be given in terms of time, we have to find relation between x and y. 

Example,

### Projectile Motion

> $$\begin{split}
> x &= (u \cos \theta) t 
> \\
> y &= (u \sin \theta)t - \frac{1}{2}gt^{2}
> \\
> \text{Putting t} & \text{ from }x \text{ into } y, 
> \\
> y &= x \tan \theta - \frac{1}{2}\frac{gx^{2}}{u^{2}\cos ^{2}\theta} 
> \end{split}$$

This can also be written as,
> $$y = x\tan \theta - \frac{ gx^{2} }{ 2u^{2} }(1 + \tan ^{2}\theta)$$
> This is used to find angle $\theta$.

Again,
> $$
> \begin{split}
> y &= x\tan \theta\left( 1 - \frac{ gx }{ 2u^{2}\cos \theta \sin \theta } \right) \\
> \\
> y &= x\tan \theta \left( 1 - \frac{ x }{ R } \right)
> \end{split}
> $$
> This is used to find range or if range is given.
