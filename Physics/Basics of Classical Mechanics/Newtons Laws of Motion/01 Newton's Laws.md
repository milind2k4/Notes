# Newton's Laws
### 1st Law: Law of Inertia
-  **Inertia:** It is the property of an object due to which it opposes any change in its motion. 
	Inertia is directly proportional to mass, and thus matter.

*A particle continues in its state of rest or of uniform motion, unless acted upon by a net force.*

$$f_{net} = 0 \implies a = 0 \implies \vec{v} = \ce{ const. }$$

If $F_{net}=0$ then the body is in equilibrium. 

### 2nd Law: Law of Acceleration 
- **Momentum(P)** is the product of mass and velocity, and is thus a vector. The direction of P is the same as that of velocity. 

	Its unit is $\ce{ kg m s^{-1} }$, and dimensions are, $\ce{ [MLT^{-1}] }$

	The magnitude of momentum is mass times speed. 


To change motion or momentum, we require some force. 

*Rate of change of momentum of particle is equal to the net force applied on it.* 

$$f = \frac{d\vec{P}}{dt} = \frac{d(m\vec{v})}{dt} = m \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}$$
> $$\vec{f} = m \vec{a}$$

Some things to note,
- $\vec{f} \parallel \vec{a}$
- $\vec{ f } = 0, \vec{ a } = 0 \implies \vec{ v } = \text{const.}$
- $f_{x} = ma_{x}, f_{y} = ma_{y}, f_{z} = ma_{z}$

### 3rd Law: Action & Reaction
*To every action there exists an equal and opposite reaction.* 

Action and reaction are forces. 

If two bodies are interacting then if they are applying forces on each other, these forces must be of the same magnitude and opposite in direction. 

They must be of the same nature. 

Action and reaction forces occur on different objects, and they act along the same simultaneously. 


## For Accelerating Bodies
$$
\begin{split}
f_{\text{hor}} &= ma_{\text{hor}}\\
f_{\text{ver}} &= ma_{\text{ver}}\\
f_{\text{ip}} &= ma_{\text{ip}}\\
\end{split}
$$
hor means horizontal, ver means vertical, ip means inclined plane.

$f = ma$ is the force in the direction the body is accelerating.
