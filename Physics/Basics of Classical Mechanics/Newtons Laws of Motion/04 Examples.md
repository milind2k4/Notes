### String Constraint
Example with block being pulled using a pulley at an angle,
![[Pasted image 20230530140535.png]]
we use the same concept and use the fact that the length of the string is fixed. 

Alternatively,
![[Pasted image 20230530143020.png]]
the velocity of the block along the rope will be the same as the velocity with which the rope is being pulled

Example where one of the blocks is in equilibrium,

Example when one of the sides is connected to the ground,

Example, to find separation when it's about to break off,

The breaking strength of a string is the max. tension it can withstand without breaking.

When there are many pulleys and blocks, instead of using string constraint, we may use,
$$\sum \vec{T}.\vec{a} = 0$$

Using the formula,

When there is velocity and the string can become slack,

### Misc. Examples
We can also apply newton's laws along a line where there is no component of one of the forces, this might reduce the calculations,

In some questions, it will reduce all the calculations,

Example, where we find the tension on a non-ideal rope hanging from two points,
![[Pasted image 20230529121424.png]]

To find tension at a point on the string, we cut the string at that point,

"Loses Contact with the Ground" is also called "Break Off". At this instant, the Normal is zero.
