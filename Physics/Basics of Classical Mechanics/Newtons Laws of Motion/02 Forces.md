# Forces
### Gravitational force
 Any force by the virtue of mass. Always attractive. 
$$f_{G} = G\frac{ m_{1}m_{2} }{ r^{2} }$$
where $G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11}\ \ce{ N m^{2} kg^{-2} }$
Unless one of the masses is extremely large, we ignore this force as it is very very insignificant.  

#### Gravitational Pull by Earth
Mass of earth, $M = 5.95 \times 10^{24}\ kg$
Radius of earth, $R = 6400\ m$

Thus, the force on an object on the surface,
$$f = G\frac{ Mm }{ (R + r)^{2} }$$
$$f = G\frac{ Mm }{ R^{2} }$$
Now, $\displaystyle \frac{ GM }{ R^{2} }$ is constant, and comes out to be $9.8$. It is thus written as $g$, thus,
$$g = 9.8 = \pi^{2} \approx 10 \ce{ \ ms^{-2} }$$
$$or\ g = 32 \ce{\ ft s^{-2} }$$

### Electromagnetic force
Force by the virtue of charge.  It can be attractive or repulsive. 
it is made up of electrostatic force and magnetic force. 

Some examples of EM forces are normal force, tension, friction etc.

#### Normal force
It is a pushing force and acts perpendicular to the common surface. Contact is needed for this force to work. 

The normal force at a point where one of the two objects ends is perpendicular to the surface which has not ended.

#### Tension in Spring
Spring always wants to stay in its natural length. Ideal spring means massless or light spring, and it will have the same tension at every point of the spring. 

When string is pulled, it exerts a pulling force on both of its ends and this force is called **Tension.**
When the string is pushed into itself, it exerts a pushing force on both ends and is again called tension. 

Thus, a spring can push as well as pull and this push or pull which is proportional to the extension or compression. This is also called **Hook's Law.**. Giving,
$$T \propto x$$
$$T = kx$$
where k is called **Spring Constant** and has units $\ce{ N m^{-1} }$ and dimension, $\ce{ MT^{-2} }$. It is property of spring. 
Also, the value of k is inversely proportional to its natural length. 
$$k \propto \frac{ 1 }{ l }$$

#### Tension in Rod
Like spring, but there is minimal to no extension. And just like spring, a rod can push as well as pull.

#### Tension in String
Like rod, but it can only pull, and not pull.

### Strong Nuclear Force
Acts between p-p, n-n and p-n. It is generally attractive. It is a very very short ranged force, acts only when the distances are in the order of fermi. 

This force is the main reason for the stability of nucleus.

### Weak Nuclear Force
It is responsible for conversion of neutron to proton. 

And,
$$f_{S} > f_{E} > f_{W} > f_{G}$$



#### Spring Balance
It gives the reading of the tension acting on the spring above. 
It gives the reading of the tension acting on its hook. 

## Weight
Gravitational Force acting on the body. 

$$W = mg$$

Diving this by g gives **kgf** or kilogram force, which is equal to g N or roughly 10 N. 

#### Apparent Weight
Normal force acting on the body. (The force we feel)

#### Weightlessness
When apparent weight of the body is zero. 

#### Weighing Machine
In general sense it measures weight (mg) or mass (m). 

In physics, it measures normal force applied on its top surface.     

## Pseudo Force
- **Inertial Frame:** It is a reference frame which has constant velocity i.e. the acceleration is zero. Newton's laws are valid.

- **Non-inertial Frame:** It is a reference frame moving with variable velocity i.e. some acceleration. Newton's 1st and 2nd laws are not directly valid. To make them valid we use *pseudo force* which is a mathematical term. 

It is not an actual force. 
$$\vec{f_{P}} = -m_{obj} \times \vec{a}_{obs}$$
Its direction is opposite to the direction of acceleration of observer. The mass is  the one on which NLM are applied.
