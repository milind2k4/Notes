# Motion Under Gravity
When the distance away from the earth's crust is negligible compared to the radius of earth. 

Consider an object of mass $m$ falling from a height, force on the object,
$$F = gm$$
where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. 

Again, gravitational force on the object,
$$F_{g} = \frac{GMm}{R^{2}}$$
where $M$ is the mass of earth, $R$ is its radius and $G$ is the universal gravitational constant. 

Now, $F = F_{g}$,
$$
\begin{split} 
gm &=  \frac{GMm}{R^{2}} \\
g &=  \frac{GM}{R^{2}} \\
g &=  9.8\ ms^{-2} \ or\ \pi^{2}\ ms^{-2} 
\end{split}
$$

Thus, $g = 9.8\ or\ \pi^{2}\ or\ 10\ ms^{-2}$

When something is released, it's velocity is the same as the thing that released it. If nothing is mentioned, then the initial velocity is zero. 

For questions in which the objects is thrown up from a higher surface than ground, to calculate maximum height make sure to add the height of the surface to the value obtained.

## Time of Flight $(T)$
### When object is dropped down
$$T = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}}$$

Since,
$$
\begin{split}
s &= ut + \frac{1}{2}at^{2} \\
h &=  0t + \frac{1}{2}gt^{2} \\
T &= \sqrt{ \frac{ 2h }{ g } }
\end{split}
$$

### When object is thrown up
$$T = \frac{2u}{g}$$

Since, to reach the top, time of ascent,
$$
\begin{split}
v &= u + at \\
0 &= u -gt \\
t_{a} &= \frac{u}{g}
\end{split}
$$

Since the ball comes back to the earth, time of decent,
$$t_{d} = \frac{ u }{ g }$$

Thus, time of flight, 
$$T = t_{a} + t_{d} = \frac{ 2u }{ g }$$

## Height Of Ascent
$$h = \frac{u^{2}}{2g}$$

Since,
$$
\begin{split}
v^{2} &= u^{2} + 2as \\
0 &= u^{2} - 2gh \\
h &= \frac{ u^{2} }{ 2g }
\end{split}
$$

## Striking Velocity
### When object is dropped down
$$v = \sqrt{2gh}$$

Since,
$$
\begin{split}
v^{2} &= u^{2} + 2as \\
&= 0 + 2gh \\
v &= \sqrt{ 2gh }
\end{split}
$$

### When object is thrown up
$$v = -u$$

Since,
$$
\begin{split}
v &= u + at \\
&= u - g \frac{ 2u }{ g } \\
&= -u
\end{split}
$$
