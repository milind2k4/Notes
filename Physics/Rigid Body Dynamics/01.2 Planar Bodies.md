### Uniform Rectangular Plate

#### Axis is in the same plane
Here we define $\sigma$,
$$\sigma = \frac{ m }{ lb }$$

If axis passes through breadth (yellow)
We cut a thin rod of mass dm. MI of this element will be,
$$dI = \frac{ dml^{2} }{ 3 }$$

The MI of the whole plate can thus be found by,
$$
\begin{split}
I &= \int \frac{ l^{2} }{ 3 } \, dm \\
&= \frac{ ml^{2} }{ 3 } 
\end{split}
$$
Which is the same as rod.

If axis passes through length (pink),
$$I = \frac{ mb^{2} }{ 3 }$$

If axis is passing through centre and is in the same plane,
If axis is along breadth (green),
$$I = \frac{ ml^{2} }{ 12 }$$

If the axis is along length (orange), we get,
$$I = \frac{ mb^{2} }{ 12 }$$

#### Axis is $\perp$ to the plane
Using perpendicular axis theorem, we can find MI about any axis which is passing through any of the intersection of the standard axes.

### Uniform Square Plate 
#### Axis is in the same plane
Both the lengths are the same, and thus we use the result from rectangular plate,

MI if axis is passing through any edge (orange),
$$I = \frac{ ml^{2} }{ 3 }$$

MI if axis is passing through centre and is in the same plane (pink),
$$I = \frac{ ml^{2} }{ 12 }$$

#### Axis is $\perp$ the plane 
Similar to rectangular plate. We can find the MI about any axis which passes through any of the intersections of the axes.

![[Pasted image 20230711124829.png]]

We can also find the MI about the diagonal,
$$I = \frac{ ml^{2} }{ 12 }$$

### Hollow Cylinder
#### Axis Passes Through Centre
Axis is parallel to Height

Since all the mass is the same distance from the centre, I will simply be,
$$I = mR^{2}$$
This result is the same for both uniformly and non uniformly distributed mass.

#### Axis is tangential
Use [[00 Rigid Body Dynamics#Parallel Axis Theorem]]

##### Parallel to the Cylinder 
$$
\begin{split}
I_{tp} &= I_{com} + mR^{2} \\
&= 2mR^{2}
\end{split}
$$

#### Axis is $\perp$ and Passes through Centre 
Similar to hollow sphere, the MI will be the sum of that of ring and rod.

### Uniform Disk
#### Axis Passes through Centre

Here we define $\sigma$,
$$\sigma = \frac{ m }{ \pi R^{2} }$$

We take an elemental ring of thickness dr at distance r from centre of mass $dm$,
$$dm = \frac{ m }{ \pi R^{2} } \times 2\pi rdr$$

The MI of this elemental ring will be,
$$dI = \frac{ 2m }{ R^{2} }r^{3}dr$$

MI of the disk can thus be written as,
$$
\begin{split}
I &= \int_{0}^{R} \frac{ 2m }{ R^{2} } r^{3} \, dr \\
&= \frac{ mR^{2} }{ 2 } 
\end{split}
$$

![[Pasted image 20230711112303.png]]

By symmetry, the MI of half disk will be,
$$I = \frac{ mR^{2} }{ 2 }$$
And that of quarter disk will be,
$$I = \frac{ mR^{2} }{ 2 }$$

![[Pasted image 20230711112405.png]]

#### Axis is along Diameter 
Using perpendicular axis theorem,

$$I_{z} = I_{x} + I_{y}$$

By symmetry, $I_{x} = I_{y}$.

Giving,
$$I_{x} = \frac{ mR^{2} }{ 4 }$$
$$I_{dia} = \frac{ mR^{2} }{ 4 }$$


![[Pasted image 20230711124034.png]]

#### Axis Tangential to Disk
Use [[00 Rigid Body Dynamics#Parallel Axis Theorem]]

##### $\perp$ to Disk
$$
\begin{split}
I_{\perp} &= I_{com} + mR^{2} \\
&= \frac{ 3mR^{2} }{ 2 }
\end{split}
$$
![[Pasted image 20230711130925.png]]

##### In the same plane 
$$
\begin{split}
I_{tp} &= I_{com} + mR^{2} \\
&= \frac{ 5mR^{2} }{ 4 }
\end{split}
$$

### Uniform Hollow Sphere
#### Axis passes through centre.
Here we define $\sigma$,
$$\sigma = \frac{ m }{ 4\pi R^{2} }$$

To take element here, we go $\theta$ angle and take a ring of thickness $Rd\theta$ which will be of radius $R\cos \theta$. This elemental ring has mass,
$$dm = \frac{ m }{ 4\pi R^{2} } 2 \pi R\cos \theta Rd\theta$$
$$dm = \frac{ m }{ 2 } \cos \theta d\theta$$
And of MI,
$$dI = \frac{ m }{ 2 }R^{2} \cos ^{3} \theta d\theta$$

The MI of the whole sphere will be,
$$
\begin{split}
I &= 2\int_{0}^{\pi/2} \frac{ mR^{2} }{ 2 } \cos ^{3}\theta \, d\theta \\
&= mR^{2} \int_{0}^{\pi/2} (1-\sin ^{2}\theta) \cos \theta \, d\theta \\
&= \frac{ 2mR^{2} }{ 3 }
\end{split}
$$

![[Pasted image 20230711113942.png]]

#### Axis is Tangential 
$$
\begin{split}
I_{t} &= I_{com} + mR^{2} \\
&= \frac{ 5mR^{2} }{ 3 }
\end{split}
$$

### Hollow Cone 
Similar to the previous, we take rings. 

The final result will be,
$$I = \frac{ mR^{2} }{ 2 }$$
