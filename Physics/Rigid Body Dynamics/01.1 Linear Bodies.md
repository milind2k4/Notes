### Uniform Rod
#### Axis is Parallel to Rod
$$
\begin{split}
I &= \int dm \, d^{2} \\
&= d^{2} \int dm 
&= md^{2} 
\end{split}
$$
This will also be the I if the mass is non uniformly distributed.

#### Axis Passes through End of Rod and is Perpendicular 
We define $\lambda$ here,
$$\lambda = \frac{ m }{ l }$$

Now, we take an element x distance away from axis of length dx and of mass dm,
$$dm = \frac{ m }{ l }dx$$
MI of this element,
$$dI = dmx = \frac{ m }{ l }x^{2} dx$$

Thus the MI of the rod can be given by,
$$
\begin{split}
I &= \int_{0}^{l} \frac{ m }{ l }x^{2} \, dx \\
&= \frac{ml^{2}}{3}
\end{split}
$$

#### Axis is Perpendicular Bisector of Rod
We can simply use the previous result by cutting the rod into two parts, finding their individual MIs and then summing them.

$$I = 2 \times \frac{ (m /2)(l /2)^{2} }{ 3 }$$
$$I = \frac{ ml^{2} }{ 12 }$$

Alternatively, we take an element like before at distance x from axis of length dx and of mass dm,
$$dm = \frac{ m }{ l }dx$$

MI of this element,
$$dI = \frac{ m }{ l }x^{2} dx$$

Thus MI of the rod,
$$
\begin{split}
I &= \int_{-l/2}^{l/2} \frac{ m }{ l }x^{2}  \, dx \\
&= 2 \int_{0}^{l/2} \frac{ m }{ l }x^{2} \, dx \\
&= \frac{ ml^{2} }{ 12 }
\end{split}
$$

#### Axis passes through End of Rod and makes an angle $\theta$

Take an element of dx, x distance away from axis of mass dm,
$$dm = \frac{ m }{ l }dx$$

MI of this element,
$$dI = \frac{ m }{ l }x^{2}\sin ^{2}\theta dx$$

MI of the rod,
$$
\begin{split}
I &= \int_{0}^{l} \frac{ m }{ l }x^{2}\sin ^{2} \theta \, dx \\
&= \frac{ ml^{2}\sin ^{2}\theta }{ 3 }  
\end{split}
$$

Similarly if the axis is passing through the mid point of rod,
$$I = \frac{ ml^{2} }{ 12 }\sin ^{2}\theta$$

### Ring
#### Axis Passes through Centre $\perp$
Axis is perpendicular to the plane of Ring

![[Pasted image 20230711111413.png]]

Since all the mass is at a fixed distance from the centre, 
$$I = mR^{2}$$
This result is the same for both uniformly and non uniformly distributed mass.

For Half ring with the axis passing through centre of curvature,
$$I = mR^{2}$$
Or we could assume the complete circle (i.e. +m mass) and then find the I by halving it.

For quarter ring, with the same axis,
$$I = mR^{2}$$
Or we could assume the complete circle (i.e. +3m mass) and then find the I by 1/4thing it.

For any circular arc, the result will be exactly the same,
$$I = mR^{2}$$

#### Axis is along Diameter
Axis is in the same plane 

Using [[00 Rigid Body Dynamics#Perpendicular Axis Theorem]],

$$I_{z} = I_{x} + I_{y}$$

Now, $I_{x} = I_{y}$ as the distribution of mass about both is the same. 
And $I_{z} = mR^{2}$.

Thus,
$$I_{x} = \frac{ mR^{2} }{ 2 }$$
More generally,
$$I_{dia} = \frac{ mR^{2} }{ 2 }$$
where dia means diameter

#### Axis tangential 
Using [[00 Rigid Body Dynamics#Parallel Axis Theorem]],
##### $\perp$ to Ring
$$
\begin{split}
I_{t\perp} &= I_{com} + mR^{2} \\
&= mR^{2} + mR^{2} \\
&= 2mR^{2}
\end{split}
$$



##### In the same plane
$$
\begin{split}
I_{tp} &= I_{com} + mR^{2} \\
&= \frac{ 3mR^{2} }{ 2 }
\end{split}
$$
