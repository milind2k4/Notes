# Newtons 2nd Law in Rotational Motion
[[01 Newton's Laws#2nd Law Law of Acceleration]]

Let there is a body about a fixed axis which has $\alpha$ and $\omega$. 

Consider a particle of mass $m_{1}$ at distance $r_{1}$ from the axis. since there is $\alpha$ there will be two forces,
Centripetal,
$$f_{c} = m_{1}\omega^{2}r_{1}$$
Tangential,
$$f_{t} = m_{1}\alpha r_{1}$$

Similarly, another particle $m_{2}$ at a distance $r_{2}$ will have forces,
$$f_{c} = m_{2}\omega^{2} r_{2}$$
$$f_{t} = m_{2}\alpha r_{2}$$

Now $f_{c}$ of each particle will pass through axis and thus will have no contribution towards torque. 

Torque will only come due to $f_{t}$, thus giving,
$$\tau_{net} = m_{1} \alpha r_{1}^{2} + m_{2}\alpha r_{2}^{2} + \dots$$
$$\tau = \alpha\sum_{i = 1}^{n}m_{i}r_{i}^{2}$$
$$\tau = \alpha I$$

Thus finally,
$$\vec{\tau} = I \vec{\alpha}$$
here we can see that $\tau$ and $\alpha$ are in the same direction.

**Note:** while writing this torque we have to write I from the axis the torque is being written. Thus, if the body id hinged we write,
$$\tau_{_{ \ce{ hinge } }} = I_{_{ \ce{ hinge } }} \alpha$$
Otherwise write it about COM,
$$\tau_{com} = I_{com}\alpha$$

To find angular velocity and speed, we apply TMEC or WET from the COM. And the KE is the rotational KE + translational KE.

To find Hinge force, we divide it into components, either in horizontal and vertical directions or along the rod and perpendicular to the rod.

In some questions, we have to take elemental rings and integrate,

The rest questions can be done using equations of motion in circular motion.

In some questions where there is no translational acceleration but there is angular acceleration, we use Newton's 2nd law in Rotational Motion,

The velocity can also be found by using TMEC, without using any of the results in the previous image,

In some questions there is static friction between the string and pulley and thus we cannot equate the tensions on both sides of the pulley.
