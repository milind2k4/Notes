# ME, Force Couple and POAF
## Mechanical Equilibrium 
It is when the body is in both translational and rotational equilibrium. 

For translational equilibrium,
$$\vec{v} = 0,\ \vec{a} = 0,\ \vec{f}_{ext} = 0$$

For rotational equilibrium,
$$\vec{\omega} = const., \vec{\alpha} = 0,\ \vec{\tau}_{ext} = 0$$

In mechanical equilibrium questions, we can write torque from any point as the whole body is at rest and every point acts as fixed hinge.

## Force Couple
Pair of forces whose magnitude is the same but directions are opposite. 

The net force is zero. Thus $\vec{a}_{com} = 0$ and there is translational equilibrium.

However, there might be torque if the line of action of both the forces is not the same and there will be rotational motion. 

This torque is given by,
$$\vec{\tau} = \overline{BA} \times \vec{f}$$
where BA is the displacement between the POAFs and f is one of the forces. 

This torque is independent of the axis chosen. This is in line with mechanical equilibrium.

The magnitude of torque can be given by,
$$\tau = f(l\sin \theta) = fl_{\perp}$$
where $l_{\perp}$ is the separation between the two LOAF and f is one of the two forces. 

## Point of Application of Force (POAF) 
It is the point at which if $f_{net}$ is assumed to be acting, it produces same torque as produced by all the forces collectively.

We can write torque from any point on the object.
