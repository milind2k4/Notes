EM radiation wavelength of which lies between $0.1\ \dot{A}\ \&\ 10\ \dot{A}$

### X - Ray production

![[Formation of X-ray.png]]

#### Continuous X-Ray
When the e goes inside the material and dissipates its energy by oscillations. This energy is lost in the form of x-rays. In this case the e loses its energy continuously. 

#### Characteristic X-Ray
When the e knocks off an e from an atom inside the metal. In this case another atom from a higher level orbit transits to fill the vacancy and releases X-rays. 

If the accelerated e knocks off a k shell electron, and an e from the shell above it, i.e. l shell, comes to fill the gap, then the X-ray is called $k_{\alpha}$. 

And if the one above that comes to fill the vacancy, i.e. the m shell, then the X-ray is called the $k_{\beta}$. 

$$\lambda(k_{\alpha}) = \frac{hc}{E_{L}-E_{K}}$$
$$\lambda(k_{\beta}) = \frac{hc}{E_{M}-E_{K}}$$
$$\lambda(l_{\alpha}) = \frac{hc}{E_{M}-E_{L}}$$

#### Minimum Wavelength of X-ray

$$eV = \frac{hc}{\lambda_{min}}$$
$$\lambda_{min} = \frac{hc}{eV}$$

Thus, $V \uparrow \implies \lambda \downarrow \implies E_{\text{x-ray}} \uparrow$

#### Intensity of X-ray vs Wavelength

![[Intensity of x-ray vs wavelength.png]]

Since,
$$\lambda_{k_{\alpha}} = \frac{hc}{E_{L}-E_{K}}$$
And,
$$\lambda_{k_{\beta}} = \frac{hc}{E_{M}-E_{K}}$$

Thus, 
$$\lambda_{k_{\alpha}} > \lambda_{k_{\beta}}$$
And the intensity of $k_{\alpha}$ is more than that of $k_{\beta}$

#### Soft and Hard X-ray
The one with more energy, small wavelength is called Hard X-ray.
The one with less energy, large wavelength is called Soft X-ray.


### Mosley Law
$$\sqrt{ \nu }= a(z-b)$$
where,
$\nu$ is the frequency of wave
$z$ is the atomic number
$b$ is the screening constant. 

$$a= \sqrt{ \frac{2Rc}{4} };\ b = 1 \text{ (for }k_{\alpha} \text{ line)}$$
