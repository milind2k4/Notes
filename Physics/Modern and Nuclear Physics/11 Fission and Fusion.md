# Fission and Fusion 
**Energy released per unit mass is more in fusion and Energy released per unit atom is more in fission.**

### Nuclear Fusion 
When two relatively unstable nuclei are brought near each other due to high speeds, they combine to form a more stable nucleus. 

At temperatures of order of $10^{9}$ K, the KE of the nuclei overcome the coulombic repulsion to come close enough for reaction.

#### Nuclear Fusions at Sun
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
{}_{1}H^{2} + {}_{1}H^{2} &-> {}_{2}He^{3} + {}_{0}n^{1} + E \\ 
{}_{1}H^{2} + {}_{1}H^{2} &-> {}_{1}H^{3} + {}_{1}H^{1} + E \\ 
{}_{1}H^{2} + {}_{1}H^{3} &-> {}_{2}He^{4} + {}_{0}n^{1} + E \\ 
 }
\end{split}
$$

The mass defect of the first reaction is,
$$\Delta m = 2M_{H} - (M_{He} + m_{n})$$
similarly for the other two.

Most of the  energy of the sun comes from these 3 reactions. 

### Nuclear Fission 
When a heavy relatively unstable nucleus breaks down into smaller more stable nuclei.

$$\ce{ X -> Y + Z + energy }$$
This energy is,
$$
\begin{split}
\Delta m &= M_{X} - (M_{Y} + M_{Z}) \\
E &= \Delta m c^{2} \\
&= (BE)_{p} - (BE)_{r} \\
&= (B_{Y} + B_{Z}) - B_{X}
\end{split}
$$

#### Reaction at Nuclear Reactor 
235 Uranium is hit with a neutron call *thermal neutron.* This converts the 235 U to 236 U which is unstable and thus breaks down into various other elements + neutrons.

$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
{}_{92}U^{235} + {}_{0}n^{1} &-> {}_{92}U^{236} \\
{}_{92}U^{236} &-> {}_{56}Ba^{141} + {}_{36}Kr^{92} + 3 {}_{0}n^{1} + energy \\
{}_{92}U^{236} &-> {}_{54}Xe^{140} + {}_{38}Sr^{94} + 2 {}_{0}n^{1} + energy 
 }  
\end{split}
$$

The mass defect is converted to energy. 

The average energy liberated on fission of 1 atom of 235 U is about,
$$\text{Average Q value} = 180\ \ce{ MeV }$$

Multiplicity Factor k comes out to be about 2 as one U releases 2 neutrons. 
When k is 2, the reaction is uncontrollable and is the one in atom bomb.

In nuclear reactor, the multiplicity factor should be 1. Thus we make arrangements which absorb one neutron.

#### Nuclear Reactor 
It is used to convert nuclear energy to electrical energy. 

It has fission of 235 U and a [[00 Alternating Current#AC Generator|generator.]]
We heat water to form steam using the heat from the fission reaction. This steam then turns the turbines of the generator to generate current. 

Here, the fission of 235 U is controlled, and multiplicity factor is around 1. 
To keep k = 1, we absorb one n from the fission. 

##### Functioning 
We hit one of the fuel rods with a neutron of $0.025$ eV energy. 
This will kickstart the fission reaction. 

One 236 U will release ~180 MeV energy and a neutron with ~2 MeV energy. This n has so much energy that it will pass through all the uranium rods. 

To reduce the energy of this n, we use moderators such as water, heavy water, graphite or beryllium. 
These moderators reduce the energy of the n by colliding with it.

This n with reduced energy will again react with 235 U and repeat the chain reaction. 

To absorb the extra neutrons, we use control rods of cadmium. 
We use Cd because it absorbs n. 

We need an optimum no. of control rods. Otherwise the reaction will not be sustainable. 

This reaction will heat up the core. 

Now, we surround the core with a conducting wall and pass cold water around it to heat.

This heated water is passed through a boiler. This will boil the water in the boiler to form steam. 

This steam is then used to turn the turbines which are connected with an AC generator. 

Now, we use a condenser to cool down the steam into water which will then get pumped back into the boiler. 

##### Efficiency
Not all the energy from the fission is converted into electrical energy. 
This is because there are many losses in the arrangement. 

$$\eta = \frac{ Q_{out} }{ Q_{in} } \times 100$$

Even if the efficiency is only 20-25%, the nuclear reactor is considered a good one.
