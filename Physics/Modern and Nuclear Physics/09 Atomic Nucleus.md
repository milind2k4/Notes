# Atomic Nucleus 
It was discovered by Rutherford in 1911. 
It is the centre of atom and practically all of the mass of atom is at nucleus. All the +ve charge of an atom is at the nucleus.

Diameter of nucleus of H is 1.7 femtometres and of U is 11.7 fm. 

Nucleus consists of neutrons and protons. Neutrons and Protons collectively are called *Neucleons.*

##### Neutron 
It was discovered many years after the discovery of nucleus (approx. 20 y later). It is electrically neutral.

It was discovered by James Chadwick in 1932. 

Mass of a neutron is,
$$m_{n} = 1.6749 \times 10^{-27}\ kg = 1 \ce{\ amu }$$

1t is represented as $_{0}n^{1}$. 
Where 0 represents charge (= 0 times e) and 1 represents mass in amu. 

Neutron only exists in nucleus. 
Isolated neutron does not exist. It decays into one proton and one electron.

$$\ce{ _{0}n^{1} -> _{1}p^{1} + _{-1}e^{0} + \vec{r} }$$

##### Proton 
It was discovered by Eugen Goldstein. 
He discovered Canal or Anode rays and proved that they are +vely charged.

Mass of proton is,
$$m_{p} = 1.6726 \times 10^{-27}\ kg \approx 1\ \ce{ amu } = m_{n}$$
Which is much much more than that of electron. 

Proton is +vely charged.  And has charge,
$$Q = +e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19}\ C$$

Proton is represented as $_{1}p^{1}$
Where sub 1 represents charge in terms of e and super 1 represents mass in terms of amu. 

##### Electron 
It is represented as $_{-1}e^{0} =\ _{-1}\beta^{0}$.
Where 0 represents that e has almost 0 amu mass and the -1 represents its charge in terms of e. 

It has charge and mass,
$$
\begin{split}
m_{e} &= 9.1 \times 10^{-31}\ kg \approx \frac{ 1 }{ 1800 }\ \ce{ amu } \\
&= 0 \ \ce{ amu } \\
Q &= -1.6 \times 10^{-19}\ C
\end{split}
$$

##### Positron 
It is the anti particle of electron. 
It has the same mass as that of e and has the charge of proton. 

When e and positron react, they destroy each other and convert into energy. 

It is represented by $_{1}\beta^{0} =\ _{1}e^{0}$

##### Representation of Nucleus 
We represent nucleus as,
$$\ce{ _{Z}X^{A} }$$
where,
$Z \to$ atomic no. = no. of protons  
$X \to$ sign on nucleus 
$A \to$ mass no. = no. of nucleons 

Thus, we have, no of neutrons,
$$N_{n} = A - Z$$

Mass of nucleus is (approx.)
$$m = A \times 1 \ce{\ amu }$$
