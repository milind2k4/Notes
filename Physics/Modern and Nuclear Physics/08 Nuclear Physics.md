# Nuclei
#### [[09 Atomic Nucleus]]
Size of nucleus is,
$$R = R_{o}A^{1/3}$$
where $R_{o} = 1.2 \times 10^{-15}$ m. 
Density of nucleus is independent of atomic number. 
Density is approximately $2.3 \times 10^{17} \ce{ \ kg m^{-3} }$. 

**amu:** 1/12 of mass of one $\ce{ ^{12}C }$ atom.

Heavier nuclei have more no. of neutrons than protons. This is so that the strong nuclear force overcomes the coulombic repulsion.

### Energy Mass Equivalence 
Mass can be converted into Energy and Energy can be converted into Mass.

To do this, we have nuclear reactions. 

Energy given when entire mass m is converted into energy is,
$$E = mc^{2}$$
where c is speed of light in vacuum, = $3 \times 10^{8}$ m/s.

1 amu gives, 
$$
\begin{split}
E_{u} &= 15.03 \times 10^{-11}\ \ce{ J } \\
&= 939\ \ce{ MeV }
\end{split}
$$

We will assume the energy to be 930 MeV to simplify calculations.

Energy liberated by mass of 1 e,
$$
\begin{split}
E_{e} &= 81.9 \times 10^{-15}\ \ce{ J } \\
&= 511\ \ce{ keV } \\
&= 0.511\ \ce{ MeV }
\end{split}
$$

### Nuclear Force
It acts between nucleons. It is attractive in nature. It is much stronger than the coulomb's force acting between charges or the gravitational force acting between masses.

If the separation between two nucleons is less than 0.7 fm, they will repel each other. 

Nuclear force does not depend on charge or which nucleons are involved. I.e. p-p, n-n and n-p will have same force. 

It is a short range force. I.e. it becomes zero very quickly as separation increases. 
$$f_{n} \propto \frac{ 1 }{ (r)^{\text{high power}} }$$

After 2.5 fermi, the force decreases drastically, and becomes zero.

(+ve means repulsive and -ve means attractive)

The energy corresponding to this force is **Nuclear Energy.**

### [[10 Mass Defect]]

### K - Capture 
Sometimes (very rarely) the nucleus captures one of the electrons of the k shell and one proton reacts with it to form a neutron. 

$$\ce{ {}_{1}p^{1} + {}_{-1}e^{0} -> {}_{0}n^{1} }$$

This happens in nucleus which has more coulombic repulsion and less stability.
