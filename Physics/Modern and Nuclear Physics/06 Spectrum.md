### Excitation and Deexcitation 
When e absorbs photon of appropriate energy and goes to an excited state it is called Excitation. 

When e releases photon of appropriate energy and goes  to a less excited state is called Deexcitation. 

We can write,
$$
\begin{split}
E &= E_{2} - E_{1} \\
\frac{ hc }{ \lambda } &= -13.6 z^{2} \left( \frac{ 1 }{ n_{1}^{2} } - \frac{ 1 }{ n_{2}^{2} } \right)
\end{split}
$$
And, we get wavelength,
$$
\begin{split}
\frac{ 1 }{ \lambda } &= \frac{ 13.6 }{ hc } z^{2} \left( \frac{ 1 }{ n_{1}^{2} } - \frac{ 1 }{ n_{2}^{2} } \right)\\
\bar{f} = \bar{\nu} &= Rz^{2} \left( \frac{ 1 }{ n_{1}^{2} } - \frac{ 1 }{ n_{2}^{2} } \right) 
\end{split}
$$
Here, $\bar{f} = \bar{\nu}$ is called **Wave Number.**

Thus the wavelength will be,
$$
\begin{split}
\lambda &= \frac{ 1 }{ Rz^{2} } \frac{ n_{1}^{2}n_{2}^{2} }{ (n_{2}^{2} - n_{1}^{2}) } \\
\\
&= \frac{ 911 }{ z^{2} } \frac{ n_{2}^{2}n_{1}^{2} }{ n_{2}^{2} - n_{1}^{2} }\ \dot{A}
\end{split}
$$

And frequency,
$$f = \frac{ c }{ \lambda } = Rcz^{2} \left( \frac{ 1 }{ n_{1}^{2} } - \frac{ 1 }{ n_{2}^{2} } \right)$$

When e absorbs photons, it is called Absorption spectrum and when it releases photons, it is called Emission spectrum.

## Absorption Spectrum 
The ground state is the most stable as it has the least total energy. 
On ground state, the e can revolve around for an indefinite time. 

On any other state, the e will release its energy and come back to the ground state. 

e can only absorb photons which have energy equal to the energy difference between two e orbits. 

When we irradiate an atom with various wavelengths of light, those which have energy as mentioned before get absorbed. These absorbed  wavelengths are called Absorption Spectrum.

Let the e go from $n = 1$ to $n = n$, Then, it will absorb photons which have energy,
$$
\begin{split}
\Delta E &= \frac{ hc }{ \lambda } \\
&= E_{n} - E_{1} \\
&= 13.6 z^{2} \left( 1 - \frac{ 1 }{ n^{2} } \right) \ eV\\
\frac{ 1 }{ \lambda } &= \frac{ 13.6z^{2} }{ hc } \left( 1 - \frac{ 1 }{ n^{2} } \right) \\
&= Rz^{2} \left( 1 - \frac{ 1 }{ n^{2} } \right)
\end{split}
$$

Thus, the wavelengths absorbed will be,
$$\lambda = \frac{ n^{2} }{ (n^{2} - 1)z^{2} }. 911\ \dot{A}$$

And the frequencies absorbed will be,
$$f = \frac{ c }{ \lambda } = Rc z^{2}\left( 1 - \frac{1}{n^{2}} \right)$$

## Emission Spectrum 
When e in an excited state goes back to the ground state, it releases photons of various wavelengths. These wavelengths are called Emission spectrum. 

The calculation of wavelengths etc. will be same as in absorption spectrum.

##### No. of Spectral Lines 
aka Types of Photons emitted. 

No. of spectral lines,
$$N = {n \choose 2} = \frac{ n(n-1) }{ 2 }$$

### Hydrogen Spectrum 
The max. wavelength which is absorbed is called $H_{\alpha}$, the next is called $H_{\beta}$, then $H_{\upgamma}$ and so on. 

The shortest wavelength absorbed by a series is called *Series Limit.*

Any series will have both absorption or emission. I.e. either if e goes from $n = 1$ to any, or if e comes from any to $n = 1$, it will be called Lyman Series.

##### Lyman series
When the e transitions from a higher energy orbital to the *1st* orbital. Or vice versa. 

Shortest wavelength is,
$$
\begin{split}
\frac{ hc }{ \lambda_{s} } &= E_{\infty} - E_{1} \\
\frac{ 12420\ \ce{ eV-\dot{A} } }{ \lambda_{s} } &= 13.6\ eV \\
\lambda_{s} &= \frac{ 12420 }{ 13.6 } \\
&= 913\ \dot{A}
\end{split}
$$

Longest wavelength is,
$$
\begin{split}
\frac{ hc }{ \lambda_{l} } &= E_{2} - E_{1} \\
\lambda_{l} &= \frac{ 12420 }{ 10.2 }\ \dot{A} \\
&= 1,217\ \dot{A}
\end{split}
$$

Thus, all of the Lyman series light will have wavelength between $[913, 1217]$ Armstrong, which is in **Ultraviolet** region.

##### Balmer series
When the e transitions from a higher energy orbital to the *2nd* orbital. Or vice versa. 

Shortest wavelength is,
$$
\begin{split}
\frac{ hc }{ \lambda_{s} } &= E_{\infty} - E_{2} \\
\frac{ 12420\ \ce{ eV-\dot{A} } }{ \lambda_{s} } &= 3.4\ eV \\
\lambda_{s} &= \frac{ 12420 }{ 3.4 } \\
&= 3,652\ \dot{A}
\end{split}
$$

Longest wavelength is,
$$
\begin{split}
\frac{ hc }{ \lambda_{l} } &= E_{3} - E_{2} \\
\lambda_{l} &= \frac{ 12420 }{ 1.9 }\ \dot{A} \\
&= 6,571\ \dot{A}
\end{split}
$$

Thus, all of the Lyman series light will have wavelength between $[3652, 6571]$ Armstrong, which is in **Visible** region.

$H_{\alpha}, H_{\beta}, H_{\upgamma}\ \&\ H_{\delta}$ of Balmer series lie in the visible region.

##### Paschen series
When the e transitions from a higher energy orbital to the *3rd* orbital. Or vice versa. 

Shortest wavelength is,
$$
\begin{split}
\frac{ hc }{ \lambda_{s} } &= E_{\infty} - E_{2} \\
\frac{ 12420\ \ce{ eV-\dot{A} } }{ \lambda_{s} } &= 1.51\ eV \\
\lambda_{s} &= \frac{ 12420 }{ 1.51 } \\
&= 8,225\ \dot{A}
\end{split}
$$

Longest wavelength is,
$$
\begin{split}
\frac{ hc }{ \lambda_{l} } &= E_{3} - E_{2} \\
\lambda_{l} &= \frac{ 12420 }{ 0.66 }\ \dot{A} \\
&= 18,818\ \dot{A}
\end{split}
$$

Thus, all of the Lyman series light will have wavelength between $[8225, 18818]$ Armstrong, which is in **Infrared** region.

Similarly we can find $\lambda_{s}, \lambda_{l}$ for the other series as well.
