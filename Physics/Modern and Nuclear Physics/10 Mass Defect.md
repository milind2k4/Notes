# Mass Defect 
It is the difference between the actual atomic mass and the predicted mass calculated by adding the masses of protons and neutrons present in the nucleus. 

$$
\begin{split}
\Delta m &= z\ m_{p} + (A-z)m_{n} - m_{X} \\
&= z (M_{H} - m_{e}) + (A-z)m_{n} - (M_{X} - zm_{e}) \\
&= z M_{H} + (A - z)m_{n} - M_{X}
\end{split}
$$
m represents mass of particle or nucleus
M represents mass of atom. 

This mass defect is due to the energy that binds the nucleus.

#### Binding Energy 
[[04 Bohr's Atomic Model#Binding Energy]]

The min. amount of energy required to disintegrate the nucleus into its constituent nucleons against the nuclear attractive force.

$$
\begin{split}
BE &= \Delta m c^{2} \\
&= (\Delta m \ce{\ in amu }) \times 931.5\ \ce{ MeVc^{-2} }
\end{split}
$$

When the nucleus forms from its constituent nucleons, some energy is released in the form of binding energy.

#### Stability of Nucleus
Stability is directly proportional to binding energy per nucleon. 

$$\text{Stability} \propto \frac{ BE }{ A }$$

The most stable nucleus is $\ce{ _{26}Fe^{56} }$.

Those with medium sized nucleus are most stable. 

Thus, the lighter elements combine to form heavier nucleus, this is called **nuclear fusion.** 
$$\ce{ X + Y -> Z + energy }$$

And heavier elements disintegrate to form lighter nuclei, this is called **nuclear fission.**


##### Observations from the Graph
Features,
1. $E_{bn}$ is practically constant for nuclei on middle mass number.
2. $E_{bn}$ is lower for both light and heavy nuclei.

From these, we can conclude,
1. The nuclear force is attractive and sufficiently strong to produce binding energy of a few MeV per nucleon.
   $\\$
2. The constancy of the binding energy in the middle region is a consequence of the fact that nuclear force is short ranged. 
   $\\$
3. A very heavy nucleus has lower binding energy per nucleon than a lighter nucleus. This means that if a heavy nucleus breaks into two lighter nuclei, energy would be released in the process. This is called **fission.**
   $\\$
4. If two very light nuclei join to form a heavier nucleus, it will have more $E_{bn}$ than the previous two combined and thus energy will be released in the process. This is called **fusion.**

#### Fission and Fusion
**Fusion** is when nuclei combine. 
$$\ce{ A + B -> C + energy }$$

This energy can be written in terms of mass defect,
$$
\begin{split}
\Delta m &= m_{A} + m_{B} - m_{C} \\
E &= \Delta m c^{2}
\end{split}
$$

Now, in terms of binding energy, since there is more binding energy per nucleon on the product side, we can write,
$$
\begin{split}
E &= (BE)_{p} - (BE)_{r} \\
&= B_{3} - (B_{1} + B_{2})
\end{split}
$$

(Q value means energy released)

**Fission** is when one big *parent nucleus* breaks into smaller, *daughter nuclei.*

$$\ce{ X -> Y + Z + energy }$$

This energy can be written in terms of mass defect,
$$
\begin{split}
\Delta m &= m_{X} - (m_{Y} + m_{Z}) \\
E &= \Delta m c^{2}
\end{split}
$$

In terms of binding energy per nucleon,
$$
\begin{split}
E &= (BE)_{p} - (BE)_{r} \\
&= (B_{2} + B_{3}) - B_{1}
\end{split}
$$

For the same quantity of matter nuclear sources produce a million times more energy than a chemical source. 

Q-factor is the gain in binding energy per nucleon times the number of nucleons. 
$$Q = \Delta E_{bn} \times A$$
