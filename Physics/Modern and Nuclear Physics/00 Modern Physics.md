# Modern Physics
#### Photon 
It is a packet of energy and is charge less.

It is the particle of light. It is also called Quanta. 
Photons can be created and destroyed. 

Photon has no rest mass. However, it does have momentum and energy. 

Momentum is,
$$p = \frac{ h }{ \lambda }$$
where h is called **Plank's Constant.**
$$
\begin{split}
h &= 6.626 \times 10^{-34}\ \ce{ J-s } \\ 
&= 4.14 \times 10^{-15}\ \ce{\ eV-s }
\end{split}
$$

Energy is,
$$E = \frac{ hc }{ \lambda } = hf = pc$$
putting h in eV-s, we get,
$$hc = 12420\ \ce{ eV-\dot{A} }$$
Thus, if we put $\lambda$ in Armstrong, we have,
$$E = \frac{ 12420 }{ \lambda (\text{in } \dot{A}) }\ \text{eV}$$

#### No. of Photons Emitted/Second 
Let a monochromatic bulb of power P emit photons of wavelength $\lambda$.

Then, in one sec, energy emitted,
$$
\begin{split}
E &= P \times 1\ s \\
n. \frac{ hc }{ \lambda } &= P \\
n &= \frac{ P\lambda }{ hc }
\end{split}
$$

#### Emissions
1. **Thermionic:** By suitable heating, sufficient thermal energy can be imparted to the free electrons to enable them to come out of the metal.
2. **Field:** By applying a very strong electric field to a metal, electrons can be pulled out of the metal. 
3. **[[01 Photoelectric Effect|Photoelectric:]]** When light of suitable frequency illuminates a metal surface electrons are emitted from the metal surface. 

### Rutherford's Model
Experiment performed by Geiger and Marsden. 

![[Rutherford's experiment.webp]]

A narrow beam of $\alpha$-particles from a radioactive source was incident on a gold foil. THe scattered $\alpha$-particles were detected by a zinc sulphide screen and a microscope. 

They observed the number of $\alpha$-particles as a function of scattering angle. They observed that most particles passed undeviated and only a few scattered by more than one degree. Few deflected slightly and fewer still deviated by more than 90 degrees.  

From this they concluded that,
- The atom has a small dense positively charged nucleus, with most of the mass of the atom concentrated in the nucleus. 
- When an $\alpha$-particle happens to come near a nucleus, the intense electric field there scatters it through a large angle.
- The atomic e being very light do not affect the particles appreciably. 

### Distance of Closest Approach
When an alpha-particle is bombarded over a gold nucleus, it is repelled by it. As a result the KE of the particle is converted into electrostatic PE. 

The distance at which the $\alpha$-particle loses all its KE momentarily is called **distance of closest approach.**

Since the PE and KE are equal,
$$
\begin{split}
\frac{ 1 }{ 4\pi\varepsilon_{o} } \frac{ 2e \times Ze }{ r_{o} } &=  K \\
r_{o} &= \frac{ 2Ze^{2} }{ 4\pi\varepsilon_{o}K } 
\end{split}
$$

#### Impact Parameter
The perpendicular distance of the velocity vector of the $\alpha$-particle from the centre of the nucleus, when it is far away from the atom. 

For large impact parameter the repulsive force experienced by the $\alpha$-particle is weak, so it passes undeflected.

For small impact parameter, the repulsion is large and the particle is scattered through a large angle. 

For head on collision, impact parameter $b = 0$ and the scattering angle is 180. 

Thus the shape of trajectory of the scattered particle depends on the impact parameter. 

## Atomic Collision 
[[04 Collisions]]

In atomic collision, any loss in energy due to collision will be used to excite the atom. 

If the energy lost calculated in the collision by Newtonian mechanics is insufficient to excite the e, the collision will be elastic.
