# Kirchhoff's Laws
#### Current Law (Junction Law) 
**KCL**

It is based on the concept of conservation of charge.

Summation of all current at any point in the circuit is zero. 

$$\sum i_{in} = \sum i_{out}$$
$$i_{1} + i_{2} = i_{3} + i_{4}$$

In other terms, the sum of all currents going out from a point is zero
$$\sum i_{out} = 0$$

#### Voltage Law (Loop Law) 
**KVL**

It is based on conservation of energy. It is just as #important as Newton's 2nd law in mechanics.

The algebraic sum of all voltages in a loop is zero.
