# Electric Flux
[[02 Electric Field#Electric Lines of Force (ELOF)]]

It is a physical quantity which represents no. of ELOF passing through a surface area. 

The more ELOF are passing though a surface, the more flux there is.

Consider a small area, whose area vector is $d\vec{s}$. An electric field which makes an angle $\theta$ with the area vector. 

Now, the component of this E which is perpendicular to the area vector is tangential to the surface and thus does not pass through it.

The component of E along ds is contributing to the no. of ELOF and thus the flux.

Thus we get, small flux through this small surface,
$$
\begin{split}
d\phi &= E\cos \theta. ds \\
&= \vec{E} . d\vec{s} \\
&= \vec{E}_{\parallel} ds
\end{split}
$$

For an extended surface,
$$\phi = \int \vec{E} . d\vec{s} $$
This is called **Surface integral of Electric Field.**

If E is uniform,
$$\phi = \vec{E}.\vec{S} = ES\cos \theta$$
where $\vec{ S }$ is the area vector.

Unit of flux is $\ce{ N C^{-1} m^{2} }$ or $\ce{ Vm }$ and it has dimensions $\ce{ [ML^{3}T^{-3}I^{-1}] }$.

Since it is a scalar product of two vectors, flux is a scalar quantity.

For a 3D curved surface, we will use projection of the surface (cross sectional area),

### Flux due to Point Charge
$\oint$ represents closed surface, i.e. closed integral.

$$
\begin{split}
\phi &= \oint \vec{E} . \, d\vec{s} \\
&= \oint Eds \cos \theta \\
&= \oint Eds \\
&= E \oint ds in\\
&= E 4\pi R^{2} \\
&= \frac{ kQ }{ R^{2} } 4\pi R^{2} \\
&= 4\pi kQ 
\end{split}
$$

Thus, for a point charge,
$$\phi = \frac{ Q }{ \varepsilon_{o} }$$
where Q is with sign. This is independent of radius of sphere, R.

Flux going out of a surface is +ve and going into it is -ve.

##### Some PTR
The ELOF which pass through smaller sphere, also pass through the bigger sphere and thus the amount of flux through them is the same. 

![[Pasted image 20231212152631.png]]

This also works for non concentric spheres as no ELOF disappears as we move from the smaller to the bigger sphere.

![[Pasted image 20231212152809.png]]

Thus, for any closed surface, if there is a charge inside the surface, the flux passing through it will be $\phi = Q /\varepsilon_{o}$.

![[Pasted image 20231212153227.png]]

If charge is not inside the closed surface, the flux through the surface will be zero as the lines which enter will also leave.

## Gauss Law
aka **Gauss Theorem**

Flux emitted by a charge Q is equal to $\displaystyle \frac{Q}{\varepsilon_{o}}$. 

Closed surface is called **Gaussian Surface.**

If there is no charge inside a gaussian surface, the flux through it is zero. 

*Surface integral of electric field on a closed surface is always equal to charge enclosed per unit permittivity of free space.*

That is, the total flux through a gaussian surface is equal to the total charge inside divided by $\varepsilon_{o}$.

$$\phi = \frac{ Q_{in} }{ \varepsilon_{o} }$$
where $Q_{in}$ is with sign.

![[Pasted image 20231212154419.png]]

If flux is zero, it does not mean that electric field is zero. However, if E is zero, flux must be zero.

The total flux is equally distributed through all the faces of a 3D shape if charge is placed at the centre.

![[Pasted image 20231212154808.png]]

To use symmetry, the shapes we are dividing the flux among must be the same for the charge (i.e. same E through them, same distance from charge).

![[Pasted image 20231212155133.png]]

If charge is placed at surface or vertex or edge, we will consider the point charge as a small sphere.
