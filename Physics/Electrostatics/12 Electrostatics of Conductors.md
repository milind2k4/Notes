# Conductors and their Properties 
in Electrostatic Conditions i.e. when the charge is at rest.

[[00 Electrostatics#Conductor]]

Here, we will consider a conductor to be a metal.

When field is applied on a conductor, the free e are the only ones that move.

### Properties of Conductors 
1. If a metal has no charge in cavity, then any charge given will reside on the outer surface. 

	In non metals, charge can stay in bulk (i.e. inside).

	Metals behave like hollow object in terms of electrostatic properties.

2. Net electric field in the bulk of conductor is always zero in electrostatic conditions. 
	$$or$$
	ELOF will not enter inside a conductor.
	
	This is because in electrostatic conditions, in the conductor, external field and induced fields are equal and opposite and cancel each other.

	$\\$

3. Field at the surface of conductor is always normal to it.
	$$or$$
	ELOF always strike normally at the conductor.

	$\\$

4. Conductor has equal potential at each point of it. 
	$$or$$
	Conductor is an equipotential surface. 
	
	Since there is no field inside, there is no work done in moving charge from point A to B. Work done in moving a charge on the surface is also zero as the field is perpendicular to displacement. 
	Thus $\Delta V = 0$ and conductor becomes equipotential surface.

### Field at the Surface of Conductor 
Here we have $\sigma$ which is *local charge density.*

We will take a cylindrical gaussian surface at the surface. 

The flux can be written as,
$$
\begin{split}
\phi &= \phi_{1} + \phi_{2} + \phi_{3} \\
&= 0 + 0 + ES
\end{split}
$$

By gauss law,
$$
\begin{split}
\phi &= \frac{ \sigma S }{ \varepsilon_{o} } \\
ES &= \frac{ \sigma S }{ \varepsilon_{o} } \\
E &= \frac{ \sigma }{ \varepsilon_{o} }
\end{split}
$$

##### Local Charge Density
$$\sigma \propto \frac{ 1 }{ \text{Radius of Curvature} }$$
This means that at the nooks and crannies, the charge density will be high. I.e. the shape edges will produce more electric field.

### Electrostatic Pressure
Any charge on the surface of the conductor experiences a repulsive force due to the other charges. This force per unit area is called electrostatic pressure.

$$P = \frac{ \sigma^{2} }{ 2\varepsilon_{o} }$$
where $\sigma$ is local charge density.

Force on part of body,
$$f = PA$$
where $A$ is the projected area of the surface perpendicular to force.
