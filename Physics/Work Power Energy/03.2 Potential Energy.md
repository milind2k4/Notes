# Potential Energy $(U)$
Energy by Virtue of relative position, orientation, or configuration. It can be +ve, -ve or zero. 

The change in U is more important than the absolute value of it. 

It is defined for [[02 Types of Forces#Conservative Force|conservative forces]] only. 

Work done by external agent against conservative force gets stored in the form of PE, and is recoverable. This energy is stored on the system and not on a single body. 

$$\Delta U = (W_{exe})_{\Delta K = 0}$$
$$\Delta U = -W_{c}$$
where $_{c}$ represents by conservative force.

For small change,
$$dU = (dW_{ext})_{\Delta K=0}$$
$$dU = -dW_{c}$$

Thus, PE is the -ve of the work done by conservative force or the work done by external agent against conservative forces without changing [[03.1 Kinetic Energy]].

$U$ depends upon reference line. 
$\Delta U$ does not depend upon reference line. 

### Gravitational Potential Energy

$$
\begin{split}
\Delta U &= -W_{g} \\
&= -(-mgh) \\
&= mgh
\end{split}
$$

Thus, if at initial PE is $x$, the final PE will be $x+mgh$.

Also, if something is completely uniform and is an extended object, we can assume that the object is a point object at the centre of mass of the extended object.

### Spring Potential Energy
Work done by external agent,
$$W_{ext} = \frac{1}{2}kx^{2}$$

Work done by spring force,
$$W_{s} = -\frac{1}{2}kx^{2}$$

Considering PE = 0 at natural length, change in PE,
$$\Delta U = \frac{1}{2}kx^{2}$$
where,
$x$ is the displacement from mean position,
$k$ is the spring constant.

Thus, using Work Energy theorem,
$$W_{s} = \frac{1}{2}k (x_{i}^{2} - x_{f}^{2})$$

##  PE and Force Relation

#### PE from Force
Let a conservative force be,
$$\vec{f}_{c} = f_{x}\hat{i} + f_{y}\hat{j} + f_{z}\hat{k}$$
And a small displacement be,
$$d\vec{x} = dx \hat{i} + dy \hat{j} + dz \hat{k}$$

Then the change in PE,
$$
\begin{split}
dU &= -dW_{c} \\
&= -f_{x}dx - f_{y}dy - f_{z}dz \\
\Delta U &= -\int_{x_{i}}^{x_{f}} f_{x} \, dx - \int_{y_{i}}^{y_{f}} f_{y} \, dy - \int_{z_{i}}^{z_{f}} f_{z} \, dz  \\
\end{split}
$$

#### Force from PE
$$
\begin{split}
dU &= -f_{x}dx - f_{y}dy - f_{z}dz \\
\text{if y, z} \to c, \\
dy &= dz = 0 \\
\text{And}, \\
dU &= -f_{x}d_{x} \\
f_{x} &= -\left( \frac{ dU }{ dx } \right)_{y, z = c} = \frac{ \partial U }{ \partial x } \\
\text{Similarly,} \\
f_{y} &= -\left( \frac{ dU }{ dy } \right)_{x, z = c} = \frac{ \partial U }{ \partial y } \\
f_{z} &= -\left( \frac{ dU }{ dz } \right)_{x, y = c} = \frac{ \partial U }{ \partial z } \\
\end{split}
$$

Thus, 
$$\vec{f}_{c} = f_{x}\hat{i} + f_{y}\hat{j} + f_{z}\hat{k}$$
$$\vec{f}_{c} = -\frac{ \partial U }{ \partial x } \hat{i} - \frac{ \partial U }{ \partial y } \hat{j} - \frac{ \partial U }{ \partial z } \hat{k}$$
This can also be written as,
$$\vec{f}_{c} = -\left( \frac{ \partial  }{ \partial x } \hat{i} + \frac{ \partial }{ \partial y } \hat{j} + \frac{ \partial  }{ \partial z } \hat{k} \right)$$
this is also called **Gradient** since we are differentiating wrt position. 

Here, 
$$\frac{ \partial  }{ \partial x } \hat{i} + \frac{ \partial }{ \partial y } \hat{j} + \frac{ \partial  }{ \partial z } \hat{k}$$
is called the **Del Operator.** an is represented by *$\nabla$* called **Nabla.**
Therefore,
$$\vec{f}_{c} -\nabla U$$

Thus,
$$F \xrightarrow{\text{ integrate }} U$$
$$F \xleftarrow{\text{par differentiate}} U$$
