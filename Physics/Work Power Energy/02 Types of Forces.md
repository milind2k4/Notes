# Types of Forces

## Conservative Force

1. Work done against which force is stored in body in the form of potential energy. 
2. Work done by this force does not depend upon path. Thus work done by a conservative force will be zero in a closed path. 
3. It cannot change the mechanical energy of the system.

e.g. gravitational force, spring force, electrostatic force, central force

Constant forces are also always conservative. 


Any work done against conservative forces doesn't get wasted, but gets stored in the form of Potential Energy. And this is recoverable. 

For example, if we extend a spring very slowly, all the energy gets stored as PE, and KE remains constant.

### Central Force
If the force is always along the line joining the interacting particles.

Its examples are gravitational, electrostatic.

## Non-Conservative Force
1. Work done by this force does depend upon path.
1. Work done against which force is lost in the form heat energy. 
3. It can change the mechanical energy of the system. I.e. the work done against it doesn't get stored, but gets dissipated in some non recoverable way. 

e.g. frictional force, viscous force, air resistance

 If the work done by a force can be found without knowing the path, it is conservative. 
 
 For example, the force in this question is non conservative and thus the work done cannot be found using only integrating. We need a relation between x and y.

In this question, different paths, i.e. different relations between x and y give different work done,

In some cases, the integration may look impossible but actually be possible, like,
