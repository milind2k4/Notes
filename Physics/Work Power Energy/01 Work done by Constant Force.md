# Work done by Constant Force
$$
\begin{split}
dW &= \vec{f} \cdot d\vec{s} \\
\int dW &= \int \vec{f} \, d\vec{s} \\
W &= \vec{f} \int d\vec{s} \\
W &= \vec{f}.\vec{S} = fS\cos \theta 
\end{split}
$$
It only depends on initial and final position. Thus, Work done of a closed path will be zero.

#### Work done by Gravity
$$
\begin{split}
W_{g} &= \vec{f} . \vec{s} \\
&= -mg \hat{j} . (R\hat{i} - h\hat{j}) \\
W &= mgh
\end{split}
$$
Alternatively,
$$
\begin{split}
W &= FS \cos \theta \\
&= mg. \sqrt{ R^{2}+h^{2} } . \frac{ h }{ \sqrt{ R^{2}+h^{2} } } \\
W &= mgh 
\end{split}
$$

Thus, going up, the work done will be,
$$W = -mgh$$

And the horizontal component of displacement has no role. 

#### Work done by Normal
Work done by normal on a single body is always zero if there are no other blocks in contact with it. 

If there are two blocks in contact, the work done by normal will not be zero on a body, but will be zero on the system.

Thus, work done by tension and normal on a system (not on a body) is always zero provided these forces are acting internally. 

Example, when the ip on which the block is, is also moving,

#### Work done by Static Friction
The work done by static friction on a block can be +ve, -ve or zero, but on the system it will always be zero. 

Thus, static friction is a **Non-dissipative** frictional force. 

If the movement is **due to $f_{s}$,** like in [[03 Two Block Problem]], and they move together, then the work done will not be zero on each block individually, but it will be zero on the system as a whole.

#### Work done by Kinetic Friction
Work done on a block by kinetic friction may be -ve, 0 or +ve. However, the net work done on system is -ve. 
This -ve work done indicates that it decreases the energy of the system in the form of sound or heat.

$$W_{f_{k}(net)} = -ve$$
$$W_{f_{k}(net)} = -f_{k}x_{rel}$$

In the case below, the net work done by kinetic friction is -ve. Work done by $f_{k}$ on A is +ve while on B is -ve, however, since the displacement of B is more, $f_{k}x_{B}$ is bigger in magnitude and thus the net work done is -ve.
