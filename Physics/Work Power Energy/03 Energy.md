# Energy
The work that gets stored in a body or the capacity to do work. 

Its unit and thus the dimensions are the same as Work. 

Within the bounds of classical mechanics, energy of an isolated system is conserved. I.e., energy can neither be created nor destroyed. 

## Total Mechanical Energy Conservation Theorem
**TMEC Theorem**

If the work done by non-conservative and external forces on a system are zero then total mechanical energy is conserved. 

Mechanical energy is the sum of KE and PE.

Using WET,
$$
\begin{split}
W_{all} &= \Delta K \\
W_{int} + W_{ext} &= \Delta K \\
W_{c} + W_{nc} + W_{ext} &= \Delta K \\
-\Delta U + W_{nc} + W_{ext} &= \Delta K \\
W_{nc} + W_{ext} &= \Delta K + \Delta U \\
&= \Delta (K + U) \\
&= \Delta(TME)
\end{split}
$$
here, $_{nc}$ means non-conservative and TME means Total Mechanical Energy. 

Thus, work done by non conservative forces + work done by external agent is equal to the change in total mechanical energy.
If $W_{nc} = W_{ext} = 0$, then $\Delta TME = 0$ and then only,
$$K_{i} + U_{i} = K_{f} + U_{f}$$
$$U_{i} - U_{f} = K_{f} - K_{i}$$
i.e. loss in KE is gain in PE.

Any question that can be done with TMEC can be done with WET.

If wedge is involved and one of the normals is external on one of the blocks. In this case, we conserve the TME of entire system.

## Equilibrium
When the net force on the body is zero. 

If the velocity is also zero it is called static, and if it is not zero it is called dynamic. 

If a particle has force zero, i.e.
$$f = 0 = -\frac{ dU }{ dx }$$
$$\frac{ dU }{ dx } = 0$$
Thus wherever the slope of U-x curve is zero.

Conservative force is always from higher potential to lower.

##### If $F-x$ graph is given and we have to check type of Equilibrium

- Find the points where $F = 0$. 
- Displace the point a little bit towards the +ve $x$.
- If $F = +ve$, then the position is unstable equilibrium.
- If $F = -ve$, then the position is stable equilibrium.

##### If $U-x$ graph is given and we have to check type of Equilibrium

- Find the points where slope is zero.
- The points at local minima are at stable equilibrium.
- The points at local maxima are at unstable equilibrium.

In graph questions where velocity is asked, we need to cross the point of max. PE, and thus we apply TMEC from starting to the maxima.

#### Stable Equilibrium
When the body wants to come back to its mean position.

The direction of net force is opposite to that of displacement. This kind of force is called **Restoring Force.**

At stable equilibrium position, there will be minima on U-x curve. 
That is,
$$\frac{ d^{2} U }{ d x^{2} } = +ve$$

Examples of stable equilibrium, pendulum and spring.

#### Unstable Equilibrium
When the body does not come back to its mean position. 

The direction of force is in the direction of the displacement.

At unstable equilibrium, there is a maxima on U-x curve.
That is,
$$\frac{ d^{2} U }{ d x^{2} } = -ve$$

Examples of unstable equilibrium are object on sphere and charge systems.

#### Neutral Equilibrium
When the body, on displacement, changes its mean position. 

When the force is zero regardless of displacement. 

Mathematically, this means that U is constant and thus,
$$\frac{ dU }{ dx } = \frac{ d^{2} U }{ d x^{2} } = 0$$
