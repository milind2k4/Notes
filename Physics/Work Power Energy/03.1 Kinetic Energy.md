# Kinetic Energy $(K)$
Energy by virtue of motion. 
The more the motion is, the more is the KE. 

$$K = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} = \frac{p^{2}}{2m}$$
It is non-negative, and zero when v = 0. 
Since there is v in the equation, KE depends on reference frame. 

If in the question, the %change in v is very small, we can use binomial approximation or differentiation,

## Work Energy Theorem

Work done by all the forces is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the body. 

$$W_{all} = \Delta K$$
all forces include conservative as well as non-conservative. 

Proof of WET:
> $$
> \begin{split}
> \vec{f} &= f_{x}\hat{i} + f_{y}\hat{j} + f_{z}\hat{k} 
> \\
> dW &= \vec{f}dx 
> \\
> &= f_{x}dx + f_{y}dy + f_{z}dz 
> \\
> W &= m\int a_{x} \, dx + m\int a_{y} \, dy + m\int a_{z} \, dx 
> \\
> &= m\int v_{x} \frac{ dv_{x} }{ dx } \, dx + m\int v_{y} \frac{ dv_{y} }{ dy } \, dy + m\int v_{z} \frac{ dv_{z} }{ dz } \, dz 
> \\
> &= m\left( \frac{ v_{fx}^{2} - v_{ix}^{2} }{ 2 } + \frac{ v_{fy}^{2} - v_{iy}^{2} }{ 2 } + \frac{ v_{fz}^{2} - v_{iz}^{2} }{ 2 } \right) 
> \\
> &= \frac{1}{2}m (\vec{v}_{f}^{2} - \vec{v}_{i}^{2}) 
> \\
> &= K_{f} - K_{i}
> \end{split} 
> $$
> Finally giving,
> $$W_{all} = K_{f} - K_{i}$$

if there is no non-conservative force,
$$K_{f} + U_{f} = K_{i} + U_{i}$$

If there is $x$ given as a function of $t$, use this instead of the usual method. 

Doing some kinematic action very slowly means $\Delta K = 0$

We can also use this in NLM questions which ask for acceleration. First find the velocity and then differentiate it w.r.t x. 

#### Examples
We only write the tension acting on the blocks, not on the string,
