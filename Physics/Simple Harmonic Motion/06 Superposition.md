# Superposition of SHM
**Principle of Superposition** states that if two or more SHMs are superimposed (applied at the same time) on an object, then resultant displacement of object will be the vector sum of all the displacements due to individual SHMs.

The summation displacement may or may not be an SHM. 

**Phasor** is the vector which represents a sinusoidal equation. Amplitude of equation is the magnitude and the phase is the direction. 

I.e. for two SHMs,
$$
\begin{split}
x_{1} &= A_{1} \sin\omega t \\
x_{2} &= A_{2} \sin(\omega t + \theta)
\end{split}
$$

We will use phasors to add SHMs.

#### Same Direction, Same $\omega$
If two SHM are in the same direction and have same $\omega$, the resulting motion is also an SHM. 


$$
\begin{split}
x_{1} &= A_{1} \sin\omega t \\
x_{2} &= A_{2} \sin(\omega t + \theta)
\end{split}
$$

Adding them using phasors,
$$
\begin{split}
x_{net} &= x_{1} + x_{2} \\
x_{net} &= A_{net} \sin (\omega t + \phi) \\
A_{net} &= \sqrt{ A_{1}^{2} + A_{2}^{2} + 2A_{1}A_{2}\cos \theta } \\
\end{split}
$$
where,
$$\tan \phi = \frac{ A_{2}\sin \theta }{ A_{1} + A_{2}\cos \theta }$$

#### Same Direction, Different $\omega$
If two SHM have same direction but different $\omega$, the superposition will not be SHM.

#### Mutually Perpendicular SHM

##### $\omega$ is the same
The resultant SHM is in the xy plane if the SHMs are along x and y axes. 

If both the SHM have sin, the resultant will be along a straight line,

If one of the SHM has cos, then the resultant motion will be along an ellipse.

##### $\omega$ is not the same
One thing to note is  that the curve will be bounded.
