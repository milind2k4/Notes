# Simple Harmonic Motion 
## Definitions
**Periodic Motion:** If a motion on definite path repeats itself after a fixed time interval.

**Time Period (T):** The minimum time interval after which the motion repeats itself. 

**Frequency (f):** The number of repetitions in one second. It has unit $\ce{ s }^{-1}$, $\ce{ Hz }$ or CPS (cycles per second)

$$f = \frac{1}{T}$$

### Oscillatory Motion
Any kind of to and fro motion. i.e. moving about a central mean point. 
The end points need not be fixed.

The end points will be fixed if the Total Mechanical Energy is Conserved. 
Then it will also be a periodic motion. 

The restoring force is,
$$F = -kf(x)$$
k must be a +ve constant. (i.e. if k is -ve, the motion is not Oscillatory)

If $F = kx^{1}$, then the motion is called **Simple Harmonic.** 

If no work is done by external agent or non conservative force, then the total mechanical energy is conserved. And the extreme positions are fixed. 

All oscillatory motion are not periodic, but if there are conservative forces, then it is.

### Linear SHM
The particle moves about a straight line.

| Mean position | Extreme Position |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| $U = min$     | $U= max$         |
| $K = max$     | $K = min$        |
| $f = 0$       | $f = max$        |
| $a = 0$       | $a = max$        |
| $v = max$     | $v = 0$          |

##### Amplitude (A)
Separation between the mean position and extreme position. 
Half of the separation between the extreme positions. 

##### Restoring Force
Force which tries to restore the position of the particle. 
It is directly proportional to displacement.
Direction is opposite of the displacement. 

Force and thus the acceleration, are always directed towards the mean position.

#### Conditions of SHM
1. Restoring force is opposite to the displacement from mean position. 
1. The magnitude of force should be directly proportional to the magnitude of displacement. 

$$\vec{f} = -k \vec{x}$$
where $k$ is the SHM constant, and $-ve$ represents that the direction of force is opposite. 
Any constant force has no effect on time period, frequency and angular frequency. It just shifts the mean position.

To prove that any motion is SHM, just show that $f \propto x$ and $x$ and $f$ are in opposite direction. 
If the force is of the form $f= a - bx$ then only $b$ is required to find the time period. 

Energy of SHM (or Oscillation) is the value of K.E. at mean position. 

#### Time at Different Positions
(T is time period)

To reach any of the Extremes, particle takes $\displaystyle \frac{T}{4}$ time. 

To reach back at the mean, it takes $\displaystyle \frac{T}{4}$ time.

Thus, to reach an extreme and to come back at the mean, it takes $\displaystyle \frac{T}{2}$ time. 

To reach the other extreme, it takes $\displaystyle \frac{ 3T }{ 4 }$ time if the particle starts from the mean.

## Graphs of SHM
### Graph Between v and x
> $$\begin{split}
> v^{2} = \omega ^{2}(A^{2} - x^{2}) \\
> v^{2} + \omega ^{2}x & = \omega ^{2} A^{2}\\
> \frac{v^{2}}{\omega ^{2}A^{2}} + \frac{x^{2}}{A^{2}} = 1&
> \end{split}$$

In v vs x graph, the bottom part will be there, but in speed vs x graph, the bottom part will not be there.

## SHM in Vertical Direction
A mass $m$ is doing an SHM in vertical direction. 

![[Vertical SHM.png|540]]

**Normal Force on Mass at Mean Position,**
$$N = mg$$

**Normal Force on Mass at Maximum Height,**
$$\begin{split}
mg - N &= m \omega ^{2}A \\
N &= m(g - \omega ^{2}A)
\end{split}$$
this is the least value of $N$ for the SHM. 

**Normal Force on Mass at Maximum Depth,**
$$\begin{split}
N - mg &= m \omega ^{2}A \\
N &= m(g + \omega ^{2}A)
\end{split}$$
this is the maximum value of $N$ for the SHM. 

**Normal Force on Mass when Mass is y above Mean Position,**
$$\begin{split}
mg - N &= m \omega ^{2}y \\
N &= m(g - \omega ^{2}y)\\
N &= m(g - \omega ^{2}A \sin (\omega t))
\end{split}$$

**Normal Force on Mass when Mass is y below Mean Position,**
$$\begin{split}
N - mg &= m \omega ^{2}y \\
N &= m(g + \omega ^{2}y)\\
N &= m(g + \omega ^{2}A \sin (\omega t))
\end{split}$$

## Examples 
We have to take care that the x in equation $x = A\sin(\omega t + \phi)$ represents distance from mean position.
