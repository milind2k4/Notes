# SHM as projection of UCM
This is also called **Phasor diagram.** 

As a particle moves in UCM, its shadow moves in SHM.

| UCM                         | SHM                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Radius = A                  | Amplitude = A            |
| Angular Velocity = $\omega$ | Angular Freq. = $\omega$ |
| Time Period = $T$           | Time Period = $T$        |

#### Proof that it is SHM
The circle has radius A and the particle is moving with angular velocity $\omega$. 

After time t, it will travel angle $\theta = \omega t$. 
At this time, the velocity will be $v = A\omega$ and centripetal acceleration, $a = \omega^{2} A$.

### Time Period

We can find min time taken to travel from any position to any other position if we use phasor diagram and unitary method.

## Writing Equation of SHM
If Initial Position and Velocity is given i.e. tt is given that $x = x_{o}$ and $v = v_{o}$ at $t = 0$.

- Put $t = 0$ in $x = A \sin (\omega t + \phi)$ and equate it to $x_{o}$. 
- This will result in one or two values of $\phi$.
- If 2 values of $\phi$
	- Differentiate $x = A \sin (\omega t + \phi)$ 
	- Put $t = 0$, equate this to $v_{o}$. 
	- This will again give 2 values of $\phi$. The common value of $\phi$ between this and the previous is the answer.

### Standard Results
When particle starts from mean position and moves in +ve x direction,
$$x = A \sin (\omega t)$$

When particle starts from mean position and moves in -ve x direction,
$$x = -A \sin (\omega t)$$

When particle starts from extreme position and moves in -ve x direction, aka *starts from rest,*
$$x = A \cos (\omega t)$$

When particle starts from extreme position and moves in +ve x direction, aka *starts from rest,*
$$x = -A \cos (\omega t)$$

### Examples 
We can write equation for any starting position if we use phasor diagram.
