# Spring Mass System

#### T from Force Method
We displace the block by a small amount and then check the force on it. 

For time period find acceleration, and from that find $\omega$,
$$
\begin{split}
kx &= ma \\
a &= \frac{ k }{ m }x \\
\omega &= \sqrt{ \frac{ k }{ m } } \\
T &= \frac{ 2\pi }{ \omega } = 2\pi \sqrt{ \frac{ m }{ k } }
\end{split}
$$

Here m is the equivalent mass of the system and k the equivalent spring constant.

#### T from Energy Method 
The total energy is,
$$TE = \frac{ 1 }{ 2 }kx^{2} + \frac{ 1 }{ 2 }mv^{2}$$
Differentiating wrt time,
$$
\begin{split}
0 &= \frac{ 1 }{ 2 }k_{2}x \frac{ dx }{ dt } + \frac{ 1 }{ 2 }2v \frac{ dv }{ dt } \\
\frac{ dv }{ dt } &= -\frac{ k }{ m }x \\
\omega^{2} &= \frac{ k }{ m }
\end{split}
$$

#### Vertical Spring mass SHM
The results will be the same as the time period, frequency and angular frequency does not depend on constant force.

#### Harmonic Oscillator 
[[Physics/System of Particles/06 Examples#When COM is Fixed]]

When both the blocks are released when the spring has some extension, then then blocks will perform SHM and will stop or have max. velocity simultaneously as otherwise the system will have momentum. 

Both the blocks will have same time period, frequency and angular frequency. 

$$T = 2\pi \sqrt{ \frac{ m_{1}m_{2} }{ (m_{1} + m_{2})k } }$$
$$T = 2\pi \sqrt{ \frac{ \mu }{ k } }$$
where $\mu$ is reduced mass,
$$\mu = \frac{ m_{1}m_{2} }{ m_{1} + m_{2} }$$
