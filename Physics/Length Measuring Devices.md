# Length Measuring Devices
## Screw Gauge
aka **Micrometre.** 

It is based on the concept of the screw, that on rotating equal angle, the screw will move forward equal length.

It is used to measure very thin diameters. In general, the least count of the screw gauge is $1 /100$ mm i.e. 0.01 mm. 

In general, there are 100 divisions in the circular scale.

Main scale is also called Pitch Scale. The horizontal line of the main scale is called Base Line or Datum Line. 

Wherever the base line touches the circular scale is the reading of the circular scale.

##### Pitch Scale
The lines of the pitch scale are at gaps of 1 mm. The longer lines are at cm distance. The LC of the pitch scale is 1 mm. 

**Pitch:** The distance covered by the circular scale on one complete rotation of it.

##### Circular Scale
It is the scale mounted on the pitch scale where it moves. 

In general, circular scale divisions (CSD) are 100. 

LC of the circular scale = LC of Screw gauge,
$$\ce{ LC = \frac{ pitch }{ \text{no. of circular divisions} } }$$

The more CSD there are, the more accurate the measurement is.

For 100 divisions, 1 CSD is of length,
$$
\begin{split}
\frac{ 1 }{ 100 }\ mm &= \frac{ 10^{-3} }{ 100 }\ m \\
&= 10^{-5}\ m \\
&= 10 \times 10^{-6}\ m \\
&= 10\ \mu m
\end{split}
$$

If the zero of the CS is below the base line, it is said to be +ve zero error and if it is below, it is said to be -ve. 

#### How to Use
The entire reading will be,
Reading = Main Scale Reading (MSR) + Circular Scale Reading (CSR) x LC

MSR is the no. of lines you can clearly see. 

CSR is the no. of division which matches with the base line. 

Thus finally, we can write,
$$R = \ce{ MSR + CSR\times LC }$$

## Vernier Calliper
It was invented by Pierre Vernier in 1631.

If both the laws are touching and the VS zero coincides with the MS zero, then the VC has no zero error. 

If both jaws touch and the VS zero is on the right of the MS zero, there is +ve zero error. 

If both jaws touch and the VS zero is on the left of the MS zero, there is -ve zero error. But this error is read from the back (right) of the vernier scale.


The main scale has markings at 1 mm and it is fixed. 

The vernier scale will move on the main scale and in general, it has less LC than the main scale.

In 9 mm of the main scale, there will be 10 divisions of the vernier scale. 

$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
10 VSD &= 9 MSD \\
1 VSD &= \frac{ 9 }{ 10 } MSD \\
&= 0.9 mm
 }
\end{split}
$$

LC = $\ce{ 1 MSD - 1 VSD = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1 mm }$

#### Abnormal VC 
Let the LC of the main scale be a and the separation between two markings on the vernier scale is b. 

Now, if n VSD = m MSD,
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
1 VSD &= \frac{ m }{ n } MSD \\
b &= \frac{ m }{ n } a
 }
\end{split}
$$

And the least count will be,
$$
\begin{split}
\ce{ 
LC &= 1 MSD - 1 VSD \\
&= 1 MSD - \frac{ m }{ n } MSD \\
&= \left( 1 - \frac{m}{n} \right) MSD \\
&= \left( 1 - \frac{ m }{ n } \right) a
}
\end{split}
$$

#### How to Use 
MSR will be line which is just before the zero of the vernier scale.

VSR will be line of vernier scale which is coinciding with a line of the main scale.

Reading = MSR + VSR x LC
